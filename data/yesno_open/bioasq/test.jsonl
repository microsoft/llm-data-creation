{"question": "Are whole-genome duplications more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast?", "context": "Also, we observe that transporter and glycolytic genes have a higher probability to be retained in duplicate after WGD and subsequent gene loss, both in the model as in S. cerevisiae, which leads to an increase in glycolytic flux after WGD We show that the retention of genes in duplicate in the model, corresponds nicely with those retained in duplicate after the ancestral WGD in S. cerevisiae Thus, our model confirms the hypothesis that WGD has been important in the adaptation of yeast to the new, glucose-rich environment that arose after the appearance of angiosperms. Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. The results uncover the WGD as a major source for the evolution of a complex interconnected block of transcriptional pathways. These selected pairs, both WGD and SSD, tend to have decelerated functional evolution, have higher propensities of co-clustering into the same protein complexes, and share common interacting partners. Moreover, we find additional transcriptional profiles that are suggestive of neo- and subfunctionalization of duplicate gene copies. These patterns are strongly correlated with the functional dependencies and sequence divergence profiles of gene copies. Functional and transcriptional divergence between the copies after gene duplication has been considered the main driver of innovations . Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts.

Conclusions: Tecovirimat treatment initiated up to 8 days following a lethal aerosol MPXV challenge improves survival and, when initiated earlier than 5 days after challenge, provides protection from clinical effects of disease, supporting the conclusion that it is a promising smallpox antiviral therapeutic candidate. Tecovirimat: First Global Approval. In July 2018, oral tecovirimat was approved in the USA for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus in adults and paediatric patients weighing ≥ 13 kg. An intravenous formulation of tecovirimat is undergoing phase I development for the treatment of smallpox infection.  Brincidofovir, an oral antiviral in late stage development, has proven effective against orthopoxviruses in vitro and in vivo, has a different mechanism of action from tecovirimat (the only oral smallpox antiviral currently in the US Strategic National Stockpile), and has a resistance profile that reduces concerns in the scenario of a bioterror attack using genetically engineered smallpox.

METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. Durvalumab in non-small-cell lung cancer patients: current developments. Single-agent durvalumab showed clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly the ≥25% PD-L1+ population. Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The therapeutic armamentarium for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has evolved considerably over the past years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab or programmed cell death ligand 1 such as atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab have shown favorable efficacy results in this patient population in the first-line and second-line setting. In addition, preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage III NSCLC. A preliminary report of a randomized phase III trial, the PACIFIC trial, demonstrated an impressive increase in median progression-free survival with consolidative durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, compared with observation after cCRT.  ICI, such as the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, have already been marketed for the treatment of pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC.

{"question": "Is obesity related to cognitive decline?", "context": "The initial results suggests that obese children have higher cognitive scores and that this result is driven by those who are female, non-indigenous and live in an urban region. On the other end of the weight distribution, indigenous children who are severely thin or thin have significantly lower cognitive scores, a relationship that holds after correcting for possible bias and appears to strengthen between ages of five and eight. Obesity is associated with decreased cognitive function, reduced gray matter volume, and impaired white matter integrity in cognition-related brain areas in patients with MDD. The data suggest that being overweight or obese in midlife may be more detrimental to subsequent age-related cognitive decline than being overweight or obese at later stages of the life span Poor cognitive performance was present in 37% of the sample. General obesity (BMI>or = 25) and poor cognition were strongly associated in the presence of abdominal obesity. Poor cognition was negatively associated with overweight (BMI 23-25) with normal waist circumference. BMI could be used as a candidate risk marker to identify people at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and as an intervention target for modifications of cognitive outcomes. Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions. Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance in young adult males. Subjects with low birth weight and adolescent overweight/obesity are at particular risk of subnormal performance. Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. Obesity in the pre-school years was associated with poorer outcomes for some cognitive measures in this study. Stronger relationships between obesity and cognition or educational attainment may emerge later in childhood. There is parallel evidence that people who are overweight or obese tend to perform worse on a variety of cognitive tasks While research in this area is growing, our knowledge of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations has not yet been synthesized. The present review integrates the recent literature regarding patterns of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations and also indicates potential mechanisms for these neuropathological changes. The review culminates in a preliminary model of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and suggestions for future research, including the potential reversibility of these changes with weight-loss.<br> Evidence for the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity is reviewed as it relates to cognitive decline. These articles indicate that the age of onset of Type 1 diabetes may be relevant to future cognitive function and that disease duration of Type 2 diabetes and sociocultural factors are related to cognitive decline during the aging process. This special issue concludes with a conceptual framework for linking obesity and diabetes with accelerated cognitive decline as related to the aging process.

Moreover, regorafenib and cabozantinib are useful second-line therapies after the failure of sorafenib. Cabozantinib in Patients with Advanced and Progressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the standard initial treatment for advanced disease.  Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo.  Positive phase III-study data have been published for lenvatinib as first-line and cabozantinib as second-line therapy.  More recently, regorafenib and nivolumab have received approval in the second-line setting after sorafenib, with further positive phase 3 studies emerging in the first line (lenvatinib non-inferior to sorafenib) and second line versus placebo (cabozantinib and ramucirumab).  The rapidly changing treatment landscape due to the emergence of new treatment options (sorafenib and lenvatinib equally effective in first line; regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab showing OS benefit in second line with nivolumab approved by the FDA based on response rate) underscores the importance of re-assessing the role of the first approved systemic agent in HCC, sorafenib.

{"question": "Is TIAM1 favoring tumor progression in colorectal cancer (CRC)?", "context": "Here, we identify TIAM1 as a critical antagonist of CRC progression through inhibiting TAZ and YAP, effectors of WNT signaling. We demonstrate that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus antagonizing TAZ/YAP by distinct mechanisms in the two compartments. In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with βTrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, high nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens associates with increased CRC patient survival. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion.

Pacritinib, a dual JAK2 and FLT3 inhibitor which also inhibits IRAK1, has demonstrated the ability to favorably impact MF-associated splenomegaly and symptom burden, while having limited myelosuppression with manageable gastrointestinal toxicity. Other JAKis, such as fedratinib and pacritinib, proved to be useful in MF.  Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia, including those with prior anti-JAK therapy, pacritinib twice daily was more effective than BAT, including ruxolitinib, for reducing splenomegaly and symptoms. Developments of JAK inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, pacritinib, momelotinib, and febratinib enabled the effective management in MF patients.   Pacritinib (PAC), a multi-kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, FLT3, and IRAK1 but sparing JAK1, has demonstrated clinical activity in MF with minimal myelosuppression.  Pacritinib could be a treatment option for patients with myelofibrosis, including those with baseline cytopenias for whom options are particularly limited. Conclusions and Relevance In patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia, including those with prior anti-JAK therapy, pacritinib twice daily was more effective than BAT, including ruxolitinib, for reducing splenomegaly and symptoms.

{"question": "Is there any role for HUWE1 in MYC signalling?", "context": "HUWE1 is a critical colonic tumour suppressor gene that prevents MYC signalling, DNA damage accumulation and tumour initiation. To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter.

{"question": "Is cabozantinib effective for Hepatocellular Carcinoma?", "context": "However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy.  Rationale for use, clinical trial data, and current recommendations for cabozantinib in renal cell cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and lung cancer are detailed in this article. More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib. Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities.  More recently, regorafenib and nivolumab have received approval in the second-line setting after sorafenib, with further positive phase 3 studies emerging in the first line (lenvatinib non-inferior to sorafenib) and second line versus placebo (cabozantinib and ramucirumab).  The rapidly changing treatment landscape due to the emergence of new treatment options (sorafenib and lenvatinib equally effective in first line; regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab showing OS benefit in second line with nivolumab approved by the FDA based on response rate) underscores the importance of re-assessing the role of the first approved systemic agent in HCC, sorafenib.  Positive phase III-study data have been published for lenvatinib as first-line and cabozantinib as second-line therapy.  Cabozantinib in Patients with Advanced and Progressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the standard initial treatment for advanced disease.  CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. Expert opinion: Based on favorable phase III clinical trial data, sorafenib and lenvatinib are considered promising agents for HCC as first-line systemic chemotherapy. Moreover, regorafenib and cabozantinib are useful second-line therapies after the failure of sorafenib.

{"question": "Is there a link between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay?", "context": "BCL11B mutations in patients affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder with reduced type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B. Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes.

Tofacitinib 10 mg + methotrexate (MTX) and baricitinib 4 mg + MTX were among the most effective treatments for active RA with an inadequate DMARD or biologic response, followed by baricitinib 2 mg + MTX, tofacitinib 5 mg + MTX, and adalimumab + MTX. OBJECTIVE Baricitinib is an orally administered inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that has been shown to be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CONCLUSIONS In patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had had an inadequate response to methotrexate, baricitinib was associated with significant clinical improvements as compared with placebo and adalimumab. Thus, once-daily baricitinib, as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate, is an effective and generally well tolerated emerging treatment for patients with moderate to severe active RA who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant of ≥ 1 DMARD, and extends the options available for this population. OBJECTIVES Oral targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including the Janus kinase inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib, are the latest addition to the therapeutic options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Five phase 3 trials of Baricitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, have been performed and showed high clinical efficacy in patients with active RA and naïve to sDMARDs or an inadequate response to sDMARDs, MTX or bDMARDs. It is also reported that safety was tolerable within the limited study period.<br><b>AREAS COVERED</b>: We here review the recent progress in the development of baricitinib and its potential for the treatment of RA. <b>OBJECTIVE</b>: Baricitinib is an orally administered inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that has been shown to be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In February 2017, baricitinib was approved in the EU, as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate, for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had had an inadequate response to methotrexate, baricitinib was associated with significant clinical improvements as compared with placebo and adalimumab. In pivotal multinational trials, once-daily baricitinib 4 mg, with/without methotrexate (± another csDMARD), improved the signs and symptoms of RA, disease activity and physical function in DMARD-naive patients and in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, csDMARDs or TNF inhibitors; baricitinib treatment also slowed structural joint damage in DMARD-naive patients and in those with an inadequate response to methotrexate and csDMARDs. Five phase 3 trials of Baricitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, have been performed and showed high clinical efficacy in patients with active RA and naïve to sDMARDs or an inadequate response to sDMARDs, MTX or bDMARDs.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome organized into topologically associated domains (TADs)?", "context": "Recent advances in our understanding of the three-dimensional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus have rendered the spatial distribution of genes increasingly relevant. In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. Form and function of topologically associating genomic domains in budding yeast. Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.

This will be the first case of MDS with unbalanced translocation between deleted short arm of chromosome 17 and Y chromosome.  We report the finding of a 2.5-Mb gene region quadruplication of Chromosome 17p13.3. This region is well characterized for the deletion leading to Miller-Dieker syndrome but has an unclear replication phenotype.  Both deletions have overlapped with the critical region of Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) and involved candidate genes such as PAFAH1B1, YWHAE and CRK. In addition, SNP array and FISH analyses on the parental peripheral blood samples demonstrated that both 17p13.3 and 17p13.3p13.2 deletions were of de novo origin. Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is caused by a heterozygous deletion of chromosome 17p13.3 involving the genes LIS1 and YWHAE (coding for 14.3.3ε) and leads to malformations during cortical development.

Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text.

Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide. They are more common in high-functioning autism and Asperger subjects.  A total sample of 10 adolescents and young adults diagnosed with AS was obtained. The high proportion of respondents with scores above the cutoff point on the overt victimization and relational victimization scales suggests that these adolescents and young adults experienced high levels of victimization. Of the sample, 20 percent met criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 30 percent met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and 50 percent had clinically significant level of suicidal ideation. Previous studies reported a high prevalence of depression among patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggested a relationship between ASD and suicidality Patients with ASD had an increased risk of suicide attempts compared with those without ASD. The suicidal behaviors are frequently observed in the adolescents and adults with an ASD without intellectual deficience.  Suicide is a major problem in Western society. However we have very little understanding of suicidal behaviour among individuals with autism spectrum disorders.  The available research provides little empirical evidence for the processes underlying suicidal behaviour in adolescents and young adults with autism  The present study aims to assess the rate of suicidality (suicidal ideation, behaviors and attempts) and associated risk factors for suicidality in high functioning ASD here is a lack of clinical awareness on suicidal behaviors of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suicidality in children and adolescents with diagnosis of high functioning autism spectrum disorder  Consistent with the previous findings, rate of suicidality is higher in individuals with ASD Detection of Suicidality in Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders Over 15% of young people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) will contemplate or attempt suicide during adolescence.

Hesperidin, a flavanoglycone abundantly present in citrus fruits, is reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. PURPOSE Hesperidin, a glycoside flavonoid, is thought to act as an anti-cancer agent, since it has been found to exhibit both pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in several cancer cell types. Hesperidin is a flavonone glycoside, belonging to the flavonoid family, which is widely found in Citrus species and acts as a potent antioxidant and anticancer agent. BACKGROUND Hesperidin, a flavanone present in citrus fruits, has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells. Oxidative stress and cancer; the role of hesperidin, a citrus natural bioflavonoid, as a cancer chemoprotective agent.

Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. The neuroprotective effect of hesperidin in NMDA-induced retinal injury acts by suppressing oxidative stress and excessive calpain activation.We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress.

{"question": "Can you computationally predict Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)?", "context": "Predicting Functions of Disordered Proteins with MoRFpred. Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, and they often facilitate protein-protein interactions. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation. MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions. MoRFPred-plus: Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences using Physicochemical Properties and HMM profiles. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure and they actively participate in performing various biological functions. These IDPs expose short binding regions called Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that permit interaction with structured protein regions. Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate. In addition, MoRFpred-plus is a downloadable predictor, which makes it useful as it can be used as input to other computational tools. OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable 3-dimensional structure and play a crucial role in performing various biological functions. Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues.Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction. It is available at http://www.alok-ai-lab.com/tools/opal/. OPAL+: Length-Specific MoRF Prediction in Intrinsically Disordered Protein Sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain long unstructured regions, which play an important role in their function. These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) participate in binding events through regions called molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. In this study, OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor, is presented. OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets. This performance improvement comes at the expense of increased run time as a result of the requirement of HMM profiles. OPAL+ is available for download at https://github.com/roneshsharma/OPAL-plus/wiki/OPAL-plus-Download. Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences Using Hierarchical Application of Bayes Rule. Key to their regulatory function is often the binding to globular protein domains via sequence elements known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors.METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40 residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions.RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values. Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences. In this study, we introduce MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFCHiBi combines the outcomes of two support vector machine (SVM) models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance. The first, SVMS, is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino acid compositions between MoRFs, their surrounding regions (Flanks), and the remainders of the sequences. The second, SVMT, is used to identify similarities between regions in a query sequence and MoRFs of the training set.RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available MoRF predictors, MoRFpred and ANCHOR. Using three test sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate MoRFpred and ANCHOR, we demonstrate that MoRFCHiBi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics. In addition, MoRFCHiBi is downloadable and fast, which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction tools.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/morf/.

Recent studies of TAD boundaries disrupted in engineered mouse models show that boundary mutations can recapitulate human developmental disorders as a result of aberrant promoter-enhancer interactions in the affected TADs Similar boundary disruptions in certain cancers can result in oncogene overexpression, and CTCF binding sites at boundaries appear to be hyper-mutated across cancers. the disruption of these structures by genomic rearrangements can result in gene misexpression and disease. TAD disruption as oncogenic driver. Recent studies have shown that TAD disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis through two mechanisms. Disruption of TAD boundaries results in aberrant gene expression by exposing genes to inappropriate regulatory elements. However, it is not clear to which extent TAD regions are conserved in evolution and whether disruption of TADs by evolutionary rearrangements can alter gene expression. Disruption of this organization by structural variations can lead to ectopic interactions between enhancers and promoters, and to alteration of genes expression patterns. Disruption of TADs can result in altered gene expression and is associated to genetic diseases and cancers. Deletion in 2q35 excluding the IHH gene leads to fetal severe limb anomalies and suggests a disruption of chromatin architecture.
