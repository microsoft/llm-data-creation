{"question": "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?", "context": "Herceptin is widely used in treating Her2-overexpressing breast cancer. However, the application of Herceptin in prostate cancer is still controversial. Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively inhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and Re-188-treated cohorts. This implies that targeting Her2 by both radio- and immuno- therapy might be a potential strategy for treating patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members are potential targets for therapy using extra-cellular domain receptor binding agents, such as the antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab  there were tendencies for upregulation of HER2, increased co-expression of EGFR and HER2 and downregulation of HER3 in the prostate cancer lymph node metastases in comparison to the primary tumors.  We performed a comparative analysis in vitro and in vivo of the antitumor effects of three different antibodies targeting different epitopes of ErbB2: Herceptin (trastuzumab), 2C4 (pertuzumab) and Erb-hcAb (human anti-ErbB2-compact antibody), a novel fully human compact antibody produced in our laboratory. Herein, we demonstrate that the growth of both androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cells was efficiently inhibited by Erb-hcAb. The antitumor effects induced by Erb-hcAb on some cell lines were more potent than those observed for either Herceptin or 2C4. These findings suggest that a systemic delivery of 212Pb-trastuzumab could             be an effective modality for management of advanced human prostate cancer. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) overexpression supports proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer (PC) Radiolabeled ABY-025 Affibody molecule provides higher contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than radiolabeled trastuzumab.  These studies indicate that dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition, administered together with AWT, sensitize prostate cancer cells to apoptosis during AWT The overall goal of these studies is to determine whether dual inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 would prolong the effectiveness of this treatment in prostate cancer.  The expression of HER2 was demonstrated and quantified in all three tested prostate cancer cell-lines. Such features would definitely favor the use of radiometal labels for trastuzumab and, most likely, for affibody molecules our data demonstrate that Her2 plays an important role in the support of AR protein stability in the transition of androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells. We hope these findings will provide novel insight into the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. These two cell lines exhibited distinct responses to Her2 activation (by heregulin treatment) on Her2 phosphorylation and Her2 inhibition (by AG825 or Herceptin treatments) on proliferation  While prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by lentiviruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind to this therapeutic antibody Overexpression of ErbB-2 and EGFR has been associated with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis in a range of human tumour types (e.g. breast, lung, ovarian, prostate Various approaches have been developed to target the ErbB signalling pathways including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab/Herceptin The data from these in vitro and in vivo studies supported advancement of radiolabeled trastuzumab into two clinical studies Tumor targeting was evaluated in mice bearing subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts of colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate carcinomas. we found that although prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by viruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind this antibody detection of prostate cancer (PCa) and advances in hormonal and chemotherapy treatments have provided great clinical benefits to patients with early stages of the disease. MAbs directed to established targets include those approved for other solid tumors, including anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) MAb trastuzumab We conclude that Her2/neu expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction of prostate cancer patients is frequent and therefore this assay may potentially be useful to detect the presence of micrometastatic disease in men with prostate cancer and for monitoring patients enrolled in trastuzumab-based therapeutic protocols. This study suggests that the docetaxel/trastuzumab combination may prove an effective therapeutic approach for HER2-expressing hormone-refractory prostate cancer. there was no significant difference in antimetastatic activity between the emulsion and the immunoemulsion despite the affinity of the immunoemulsion towards the HER2 receptor.  a targeted drug delivery system based on cationic emulsion covalently linked to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (Herceptin), in a well-established in vivo pharmacologic model of metastatic prostate cancer that overexpresses the HER2 receptor The finding of strong, consistent HER-2/neu expression in ACBCC suggests that treatment with Herceptin (trastuzumab) may be effective in patients with this rare tumour. Although HER2 can be over-expressed in prostate cancer, there is no clinical data to support the use of trastuzumab for prostate cancer patients. whereas the effect of the trastuzumab-RT combination was inferior to that predicted by the individual effects. HER 1-2 targeting of hormone-refractory prostate cancer by ZD1839 and trastuzumab Trastuzumab (Herceptin) as a single agent demonstrated poor efficacy in treating HRPC. To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of the antibody to the HER-2/neu receptor (trastuzumab, Herceptin) in the treatment of advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) Conclusions regarding the predictive value of HER-2 status on outcome after trastuzumab-based therapy were not reached and were only drawn after larger-scale screening efforts.  rastuzumab plus docetaxel in HER-2/neu-positive prostate carcinoma clinical trials are currently in progress in patients with prostate cancer testing novel agents that selectively interfere with these receptors, such as trastuzumab, ytotoxicity of human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and induction of apoptosis using 213Bi-Herceptin alpha-conjugate The clinical interpretation of c-erbB-2 abnormalities should reflect the complexity of c-erbB-2 mediated regulatory pathway and explain why tumours with overexpression/amplification of c-erbB-2 very often do not respond to therapy using Herceptin HER-2 overexpression also has been reported in up to 60% of patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPC) and was correlated with shortened survival Unlike breast carcinoma and contrary to prior reports, HER-2 overexpression by IHC in archival prostate tissue from patients who eventually developed hormone-refractory disease was infrequent. There did not appear to be any correlation between HER-2 overexpression by IHC and shed HER-2 antigen levels in serum by ELISA in this tumor type. Further development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2 positive tumors. the expression of ERBB2 in prostate cancer is relatively low, and is not altered during disease progression. Thus, it is unlikely that treatment modalities relying on the overexpression of ERBB2 gene will be useful in treating prostate cancer. A phase I study was designed to evaluate docetaxel/estramustine plus trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 receptor, in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) Laboratory evidence also supports the clinical evaluation of docetaxel-based combinations that include agents such as trastuzumab and/or estramustine trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 receptor; immunotoxin conjugates use an antibody directed against EGFR joined to a cell toxin. All are in clinical trials for a number of cancers, including prostate cancer we investigated the antitumor efficacy of Herceptin, a new recombinant humanized anti-HER2/neu antibody, which exhibits cytostatic activity on breast and prostate cancer cells that overexpress the HER2 oncogene. trastuzumab was found to have additive and synergistic effects with some chemotherapeutic agents ER-2/neu as a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer in these prostate cancer model systems, Herceptin alone has clinical activity only in the androgen-dependent tumor and has at least an additive effect on growth, anti-HER2 receptor monoclonal antibody Herceptin significantly enhanced growth inhibition of the MDA PCa 2a cells.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Are ultraconserved elements often transcribed?", "context": "Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) Our data gives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising protein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates, act as enhancers and can be transcribed during development The majority of these regions map onto ultraconserved elements and we demonstrate that they can act as functional enhancers within the organism of origin, as well as in cross-transgenesis experiments, and that they are transcribed in extant species of Olfactores. We refer to the elements as 'Olfactores conserved non-coding elements' We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand. Although the nature of these transcripts remains a mistery, our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq datasets indicates that they are unlikely to be short RNAs and that some of them might encode nuclear transcripts Our data shows that the concurrent presence of enhancer and transcript function in non-exonic UCE elements is more widespread than previously shown. Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand Short ultraconserved promoter regions delineate a class of preferentially expressed alternatively spliced transcripts The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition. Other ncRNAs, such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) and large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key elements of cellular homeostasis. The majority of these regions map onto ultraconserved elements and we demonstrate that they can act as functional enhancers within the organism of origin, as well as in cross-transgenesis experiments, and that they are transcribed in extant species of Olfactores. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates, act as enhancers and can be transcribed during development. The Evf-2 noncoding RNA is transcribed from the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region and functions as a Dlx-2 transcriptional coactivator. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. These studies identify a critical role for TUC338 in regulation of transformed cell growth and of transcribed ultraconserved ncRNA as a unique class of genes involved in the pathobiology of HCC.

{"question": "Have Quantitative Trait Loci affecting splicing (splicing QTLs) been linked to disease?", "context": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a widely used rodent model of hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Previously we identified thousands of cis-regulated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across multiple tissues using a panel of rat recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from Brown Norway and SHR progenitors. These cis-eQTLs represent potential susceptibility loci underlying physiological and pathophysiological traits manifested in SHR. We have prioritized 60 cis-eQTLs and confirmed differential expression between the parental strains by quantitative PCR in 43 (72%) of the eQTL transcripts. These colocalizing correlated cis-eQTLs (c3-eQTLs) are highly attractive as primary susceptibility loci for the colocalizing pQTLs. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the c3-eQTL genes identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are predicted to affect transcription factor binding affinity, splicing and protein function. These SNPs, which potentially alter transcript abundance and stability, represent strong candidate factors underlying not just eQTL expression phenotypes, but also the correlated metabolic and physiological traits. In conclusion, by integration of genomic sequence, eQTL and QTT datasets we have identified several genes that are strong positional candidates for pathophysiological traits observed in the SHR strain. Identifying associations between genotypes and gene expression levels using microarrays has enabled systematic interrogation of regulatory variation underlying complex phenotypes. This approach has vast potential for functional characterization of disease states, but its prohibitive cost, given hundreds to thousands of individual samples from populations have to be genotyped and expression profiled, has limited its widespread application.RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that genomic regions with allele-specific expression (ASE) detected by sequencing cDNA are highly enriched for cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) identified by profiling of 500 animals in parallel, with up to 90% agreement on the allele that is preferentially expressed. We also observed widespread noncoding and antisense ASE and identified several allele-specific alternative splicing variants.CONCLUSION: Monitoring ASE by sequencing cDNA from as little as one sample is a practical alternative to expression genetics for mapping cis-acting variation that regulates RNA transcription and processing. The six genes corresponded to rat and mouse quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had shown associations with the common traits such as the well characterized MS and even tumor susceptibility. Our findings suggest that the six genes may play important roles in the pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and the MS, which increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The use of the multivariate phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic risk factors, accounting for the pleiotropic effects when the multivariate phenotypes have a common etiological pathway. To elucidate mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), we studied genetic regulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats, assuming a conservation of pathogenic pathways. In this study, we focused on Eae23, originally identified to regulate EAE in a (LEW.1AV1xPVG.1AV1)F2 cross. Our aim was to determine whether one or more genes within the 67 Mb region regulate EAE and to define candidate risk genes.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used high resolution quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in the 10th generation (G10) of an advanced intercross line (AIL) to resolve Eae23 into two QTLs that independently regulate EAE, namely Eae23a and Eae23b.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is alternative splicing of apoptotic genes playing a role in the response to DNA or mitochondrial damage?", "context": "Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted, confirming the relevance of this mechanism. We demonstrate that E2F1 requires SC35 to switch the alternative splicing profile of various apoptotic genes such as c-flip, caspases-8 and -9 and Bcl-x, towards the expression of pro-apoptotic splice variants. Finally, we provide evidence that E2F1 upregulates SC35 in response to DNA-damaging agents and show that SC35 is required for apoptosis in response to these drugs. This analysis revealed that DNA damage resulted in changes in splicing activity that modified the splicing pattern of Fas, a key pro-apoptotic, p53-inducible death receptor. Bortezomib induces mitochondrial damage in native cells and also activates the UPR by splicing of Xbp-1 and induction of CHOP, which is significantly reduced by silencing of MUC4. The tumour-suppressor protein p53 is an important activator of apoptosis. Although p53-deficient cancer cells are less responsive to chemotherapy, their resistance is not complete, which suggests that other apoptotic pathways may exist. A p53-related gene, p73, which encodes several proteins as a result of alternative splicing, can also induce apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was significantly reduced in P388/SPR cells, as indicated by minimal DNA fragmentation.

Both SGs and PBs contain mRNA, eIF4E, microRNAs and argonaute proteins, and various regulators of mRNA stability and translation (TTP, RCK/p54, and CPEB). An alternative pathway of mRNA degradation occurs at processing bodies, cytoplasmic foci that contain decapping enzymes, the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1 and the Lsm1-7 heptamer.  n eukaryotic cells degradation of bulk mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction requires the consecutive action of the decapping complex (consisting of DCP1 and DCP2) and the 5' to 3' exonuclease XRN1. These enzymes are found in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies (because of the accumulation of the GW182 antigen). Several proteins that stimulate mRNA decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex co-localize with Dcp1 and Dcp2, together with Xrn1, a 5'-to-3' exonuclease, to structures in the cytoplasm called processing bodies.   On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3. We identified the Pab 1801 cytoplasmic puncta as P Bodies (PBs), which are involved in mRNA regulation. We found that, in several cell lines, including U2OS, WI38, SK-N-SH and HCT116, the Pab 1801 puncta strictly colocalize with PBs identified with specific antibodies against the PB components Hedls, Dcp1a, Xrn1 or Rck/p54. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5'-3' exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. The second type of granules, piP-bodies, harbors the MIWI2-TDRD9-MAEL module of the piRNA pathway and signature components of P-bodies, GW182, DCP1a, DDX6/p54, and XRN1 proteins. In yeast and human tissue culture cells, Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), dynamic cytoplasmic granules where RNA degradation can take place.

Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. Here we show that microscopically visible P-bodies are greatly diminished following West Nile viral infection, but the component proteins are not depleted. On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3. Owing to the essential functions of P bodies in mRNA regulation, we explored computationally the functional significance of SNPs in 7 P body components such as XRN1, DCP2, EDC3, CPEB1, GEMIN5, STAU1 and TRIM71. Computational analyses of non-synonymous SNPs of these components was initiated using well utilized publicly available software programs such as the SIFT, followed by PolyPhen, PANTHER, MutPred, I-Mutant-2. Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), Here, we show that hDIS3L2 is an exosome-independent cytoplasmic mRNA 3'-5' exonuclease, which exhibits processive activity on structured RNA substrates in vitro. hDIS3L2 associates with hXRN1 in an RNA-dependent manner and can, like hXRN1, be found on polysomes Inhibition of TAK1-JNK signaling also affected the number and size of P bodies and the localization of DCP1a, Xrn1, and Edc4.  The organizing mechanism that forms P body foci in cells is unknown; however, potential scaffolding, aggregating, or other regulatory proteins found in P bodies were investigated for degradation. Two factors involved in 5'-end mRNA decapping and degradation, Xrn1 and Dcp1a, and the 3' deadenylase complex component Pan3 underwent accelerated degradation during infection, and Dcp1a may be a direct substrate of PV 3C proteinase. Secondly, P-bodies recruit mRNAs that are targeted for deadenylation and degradation by the decapping/Xrn1 pathway.  Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with knockdown of the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1.

{"question": "Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?", "context": "Survivin (BIRC5) is one of the members of IAP-family apoptosis inhibitors. The BIRCS gene is expressed in most human embryonic tissues and malignant tumors but not in normal differentiated tissues of adult human. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that is undetectable in most terminally differentiated normal human tissues, strongly expressed in embryonic and fetal organs and is strongly expressed in many different human cancers. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor apoptosis family that is overexpressed in many malignancies. It has five known alternative splice forms, some of which differ in their antiapoptotic properties and expression levels in human cancers. survivin is usually not expressed in normal adult tissues, AZD1152-hQPA induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of some cell lines, demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-9, followed by activation of caspase-3. This effect was accompanied by the inhibition of survivin expression. In vivo efficacy was determined in NOD/SCID/γc(null) mice implanted with the Ramos human BL cell line. AZD1152 had anti-tumour effects in this murine xenograft model. There preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in BL and HL. a novel antiapoptosis gene, i.e., survivin, was identified as a structurally unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. Survivin expression is turned off during fetal development and not found in non-neoplastic adult human tissues but is again turned on in the most common human cancers. The antiapoptotic properties of survivin might provide a significant growth advantage in tumors and possibly also contribute to chemoresistance of cancer. Further comparison of the distribution of PDEF with other widely recognized cancer-associated molecules showed that PDEF has more restricted distributions than Her-2/neu, Bcl-2, survivin or telomerase in cDNA libraries from normal human tissues and more increased distribution than Her-2/neu, CA-125, Bcl-2, survivin and telomerase in cDNA libraries from brain (except survivin), breast, lung and ovarian tumors. These data together show a better tumor-association for PDEF and suggest that PDEF is a more suitable target for developing specific cancer therapies. we identified decreased FHIT expression resulting in apoptosis inhibition and decreasing apoptosis associated with abnormal levels of some pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and Survivin) by TUNEL and TMA. Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Both TUNEL and TMA experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2.

{"question": "Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?", "context": "Several labs have obtained evidence for a protein complex that involves many of the nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the virus. NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins. A fluorescently labeled form of NS3 was used to investigate this interaction through fluorescence polarization binding assays. Results from this assay support interactions that include a 1:1 complex formed between NS3 and NS5B. Contradictory results have been reported regarding NS3 in RNA synthesis. To investigate the effect of NS3 on classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) activity and NS3-NS5B interaction, RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses containing NS5B and either of NS3 protein and the different truncated NS3 mutants were performed, respectively. We found that NS3 stimulated NS5B RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner by binding to NS5 through a NS3 protease domain. Furthermore, mapping important regions of the NS3 protease domain was carried out by deletion mutagenesis, associated with RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Results showed that stimulation of CSFV NS5B RdRp activity was obtained by NS3 binding to NS5B through a 31-amino acid fragment at the N-terminal end of NS3 protease domain, which mediated a specific NS3-NS5B interaction. The protocols detailed in this unit are used to purify three recombinant enzymes that are widely used in HCV research: the HCV NS3 protease domain, the helicase domain as an NS3+NS4A complex, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The active enzymes are purified to homogeneity by two-column chromatography to support a screening program for HCV inhibitors. Among potential targets are viral entry factors, including scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) and CD81, as well as neutralizing antibodies against the viral glycoproteins. Popular targets related to translation and replication are the NS3/4A protease (inhibited by telaprevir and boceprevir) and the NS5B polymerase, as well as the NS2/3 autoprotease, the NS3 helicase, and nonenzymatic targets such as NS4B and NS5A proteins.  The NS3 helicase domain competes with NS3 full-length for NS5 RdRp binding, with a K(d.) of 2.5μM. Since NS3 and NS5 are required for DENV replication, this fascile assay could be used to screen for non-nucleoside, allosteric inhibitors that disrupt the interaction between the two proteins.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Are psammoma bodies characteristic to meningiomas?", "context": "Psammoma bodies (PBs) are concentric lamellated calcified structures, observed most commonly in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), meningioma, and papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary but have rarely been reported in other neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions. Studies on serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and meningioma, however, revealed that collagen production by neoplastic cells and subsequent calcification was responsible for the formation of PBs. The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells. Light microscopy revealed abundant microcysts of varied size throughout the tumor tissue with the presence of whorl formation and psammoma body, but no malignancy was indicated. Electron microscopy further demonstrated interdigitation of the neighboring cell membranes, desmosomes, and intracytoplasmic filaments, which are pathognomonic findings of meningiomas. Unlike SFT, FMs were glycogen-containing and variously exhibited a storiform pattern (13 of 20), psammoma body formation (9 of 20), and calcification of collagen (4 of 20). Immunoreactivities included vimentin (100%), focal to patchy EMA (80%), S-100 protein (80%), collagen IV (25%), and patchy, mild-to-moderate CD34 staining (60%). In contrast to the inner structure, three-dimensional structure of psammona bodies in meningiomas is not well defined. This study examined three cultured meningiomas, in which surface observation of psammoma bodies might be easier than in the tumor tissues since influence of interposing connective tissue is minimized in tissue culture. The results suggest that psammoma bodies in meningiomas arise in part from meningothelial whorls due to collagen production by tumor cells followed by obliteration and disappearance of tumor cell processes, although some of the alternative pathways for psammoma body formation proposed by other investigators cannot be ruled out by this study. To demonstrate that psammoma bodies in human meningiomas contain type VI collagen and laminin. This is the first report to describe the involvement of type VI collagen in psammoma bodies and whorl formations in meningiomas. Calcification such as psammoma body is sometimes found especially in spinal cord meningioma but ossification of the meningeal tumor was rarely observed. Histological diagnosis was transitional meningioma with psammoma body. In this study we analyzed the morphologic and ultrastructural characteristics of the psammoma bodies in ten meningiomas of different histologic subtypes, characterizing the components of the psammoma body and the elements of the tumor, such as the capillaries and degenerative cells that have been classically considered as initiators of the formation of these calcareous is structures. It is concluded that the mineralization of the psammoma bodies is induced principally by the collagen fibers synthesized by the meningocytes and that the form of mineralization is spherical and growth is radial, controlled by the tumoral cells. CSF cytology revealed benign fibroblastic or meningotheliomatous meningioma with whorl formation and psammoma body. Electron microscopic examination of the calculi showed membrane-bound vesicles and radially precipitated crystals that simulated hydroxyapatite of psammoma body in meningioma. Psammoma bodies in meningiomas resembled those in the choroid plexus stroma. The results of this study suggest that psammoma bodies in the choroid plexus, as in meningiomas, form by a process of dystrophic calcification associated with arachnoid cells and collagen fibres. An early stage of psammoma body formation was seen more frequently in these villous microcores than in the meningocytic whorls. Psammoma bodies in meningocytic whorls were investigated by electron microscopy. Psammoma body formation in the meningocytic whorls may represent degeneration in some whorls of the central cells which contain connective tissue fibers, producing cell debris such as membrane invested vesicles. Twenty human meningiomas were examined for IgG and IgM by the direct immunofluorescence of immunoperoxidase methods, or both. IgG was conspicuously found in and around the blood vessels, whorls, and psammoma bodies. It was also clearly present on the cytoplasmic membranes of the tumour cells. Significance of these findings is briefly discussed including possible humoral immune reactions in regard to whorl and psammoma body formation in meningioma. The fine structure of psammoma bodies was examined in four cases of fibroblastic meningioma. In general, large numbers of various-sized calcified bodies (psammoma bodies) were scattered among the interstitial fibers. These findings suggest that both matrix giant bodies and matrix vesicles may serve as initial nidus of calcification of psammoma bodies in fibroblastic meningioma. Psammoma body formation or dystrophic mineralization and gliosis of the intervening parenchyma was observed in all three cases.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Does the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) interact with triadin?", "context": "The HRC effects on RyR may be regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein.  HRC may play a key role in the regulation of SR Ca cycling through its direct interactions with SERCA2 and triadin, mediating a fine cross talk between SR Ca uptake and release in the heart. Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to both triadin (TRN) and SERCA affecting Ca(2+) cycling in the SR. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. The histidine-rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity Ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Because HRC appears to interact directly with triadin, HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling. In the present study, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and show that HRC binds directly to triadin, which is an integral membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported. The present study documents the binding interaction of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein triadin with peripheral histidine-rich, Ca(2+)-binding protein (HCP). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRCBP) is expressed in the junctional SR, the site of calcium release from the SR. HRCBP is expressed exclusively in muscle tissues and binds calcium with low affinity and high capacity. In addition, HRCBP interacts with triadin, a protein associated with the ryanodine receptor and thought to be involved in calcium release. Its calcium binding properties, localization to the SR, and interaction with triadin suggest that HRCBP is involved in calcium handling by the SR. Using a fusion protein binding assay, we further identified the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC as responsible for the binding of HRC to triadin.  The HRC binding domain of triadin was also localized by fusion protein binding assay to the lumenal region containing the KEKE motif that was previously shown to be involved in the binding of triadin to calsequestrin. Notably, the interaction of HRC and triadin is Ca(2+)-sensitive. Our data suggest that HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by interaction with triadin. Further support for colocalization of HRC with triadin cytoplasmic domain is provided here by experiments of mild tryptic digestion of tightly sealed TC vesicles. We demonstrate that HRC can be isolated as a complex with triadin, following equilibrium sucrose-density centrifugation in the presence of mM Ca(2+). Here, we characterized the COOH-terminal portion of rabbit HRC, expressed and purified as a fusion protein (HRC(569-852)), with respect to Ca(2+)-binding properties, and to the interaction with triadin on blots, as a function of the concentration of Ca(2+). Our results identify the polyglutamic stretch near the COOH terminus, as the Ca(2+)-binding site responsible, both for the acceleration in mobility of HRC on SDS-PAGE in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Ca(2+), and for the enhancement by high Ca(2+) of the interaction between HRC and triadin cytoplasmic segment. In addition to providing further evidence that HCP coenriches with RyR1, FKBP-12, triadin and calsequestrin (CS) in sucrose-density-purified TC vesicles, using specific polyclonal antibody, we show it to be expressed as a single protein species, both in fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers, and to identically localize to the I-band. Colocalization of HCP and triadin at junctional triads is supported by the overlapping staining pattern using monoclonal antibodies to triadin. We show a specific binding interaction between digoxigenin-HCP and triadin, using ligand blot techniques. Suggesting that triadin dually interacts with HCP and with CS, at distinct sites, we have found that triadin-CS interaction in overlays does not require the presence of Ca2+. These differential effects form the basis for the hypothesis that HCP anchors to the junctional membrane domain of the SR, through binding to triadin short cytoplasmic domain at the NH2 terminus. Although the function of this interaction, as such, is not well understood, it seems of potential biological interest within the more general context of the structural-functional role of triadin at the triadic junction in skeletal muscle. BACKGROUND: Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to both triadin (TRN) and SERCA affecting Ca(2+) cycling in the SR. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Interaction of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) and triadin in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is an SR component that binds to triadin and may affect Ca release through the ryanodine receptor.

{"question": "Is oxalate renal excretion increased after bariatric surgery?", "context": "Despite the fact that bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality and improvement in renal function, bariatric surgery has recently been shown to be associated with a significant risk of nephrolithiasis. The main risk factor for nephrolithiasis is increased excretion of urinary oxalate. Enteric hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, and oxalate nephropathy must be considered with the other risks of RYGBP. The urinary excretion of oxalate was high: 1.112 mumol/24 h (normal range: 55-400 mumol/24 h), and citrate excretion was low: 1.48 mmol/24 h (normal range: 2-5 mmol/24 h).  Hyperoxaluria in patients with JIB was found to be a result of hyperabsorption of oxalate, and these patients displayed altered oxalate kinetics with continued urinary excretion of orally administered 14C-oxalate for more than 48 hours.  Malabsorption of calcium and low fasting urinary calcium excretion in the JIB patients were associated with high tubular reabsorption of calcium, the latter presumably attributable to a compensatory increase in circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). In most recurrent renal stone formers the urinary calcium concentration was increased, with an inverse relationship to serum PTH, indicating intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium.

{"question": "Is there a relationship between junctin and ryanodine receptors?", "context": "Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.  Junctin ablation appears to affect how RyRs 'sense' SR Ca(2+) load, resulting in decreased diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak despite an elevated [Ca(2+)](SR).  Single channel recordings of RyRs from WT and JCN-KO cardiac SR indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of RyRs to luminal [Ca(2+)]: at low luminal [Ca(2+)] (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid RyR channels are less responsive to luminal [Ca(2+)]; conversely, high luminal [Ca(2+)] turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation. Thus, junctin produces complex effects on Ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal [Ca(2+)]-dependent dual response of junctin-devoid RyRs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of RyR channels at low luminal [Ca(2+)], and as an inhibitor at high luminal [Ca(2+)]. Normal Ca(2+) signalling in skeletal muscle depends on the membrane associated proteins triadin and junctin and their ability to mediate functional interactions between the Ca(2+) binding protein calsequestrin and the type 1 ryanodine receptor in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We show here that purified skeletal ryanodine receptors are similarly activated by purified triadin or purified junctin added to their luminal side, although a lack of competition indicated that the proteins act at independent sites. Surprisingly, triadin and junctin differed markedly in their ability to transmit information between skeletal calsequestrin and ryanodine receptors. Purified calsequestrin inhibited junctin/triadin-associated, or junctin-associated, ryanodine receptors and the calsequestrin re-associated channel complexes were further inhibited when luminal Ca(2+) fell from 1mM to By fusing GCaMP6f to the N-terminus of triadin 1 or junctin, GCaMP6f-T/J was targeted to dyadic junctions, where it colocalized with t-tubules and RyRs after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer.  The junctional face of the jSR, facing the transverse tubules, is occupied by a molecular complex composed of the transmembrane Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors); the luminal protein calsequestrin (CSQ); the 2 membrane proteins, junctin (Jct), and triadin (Tr), which mediate CSQ-ryanodine receptor interactions; and several other components. Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the ryanodine receptor and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. We examined the influence of phosphorylation of calsequestrin on its ability to store calcium, to polymerise and to regulate ryanodine receptors by binding to triadin and junctin.  Junctin is a 26 kDa membrane protein that binds to calsequestrin, triadin, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) within the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of calcium release units.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is JTV519 (K201) a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias?", "context": "We compared the suppressive effect of K201 (JTV519), a multiple-channel blocker and cardiac ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) stabilizer, with that of diltiazem, a Ca(2+ )channel blocker, in 2 studies of isoproterenol-induced (n = 30) and ischemic-reperfusion-induced VAs (n = 38) in rats.  After administration of isoproterenol under Ca(2+) loading, fatal VA frequently occurred in the vehicle (9 of 10 animals, 90%) and diltiazem (8 of 10, 80%) groups, and K201 significantly suppressed the incidences of arrhythmia and mortality (2 of 10, 20%). In the reperfusion study, the incidence and the time until occurrence of reperfusion-induced VA and mortality were significantly suppressed in the K201 (2 of 15 animals, 13%) and diltiazem (1 of 9 animals, 11%) groups compared to the vehicle group (8 of 14 animals, 57%).  K201 markedly suppressed both the isoproterenol-induced and the reperfusion-induced VAs, whereas diltiazem did not suppress the isoproterenol-induced VA. JTV519 (K201) is a newly developed 1,4-benzothiazepine drug with antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective properties. It appears to be very effective in not only preventing but also in reversing the characteristic myocardial changes and preventing lethal arrhythmias. The novel antiarrhythmic drug K201 (4-[3-{1-(4-benzyl)piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride) is currently in development for treatment of atrial fibrillation. K201 not only controls intracellular calcium release by the ryanodine receptors, but also possesses a ventricular action that might predispose to torsade de pointes arrhythmias.  The RyR is currently used as a therapeutic target in malignant hyperthermia where dantrolene is effective and to relieve ventricular arrhythmia, with the use of JTV519 and flecainide. Finally, KN-3 and JTV519, two compounds that stabilize RyR2 in the closed state, prevent the induction of triggered activity and suppress the inducibility of sustained AF.  JTV-519 greatly reduced the frequency of ouabain-induced arrhythmogenic events. Stabilization of RyR2 by JTV-519 effectively reduces these triggered arrhythmias. These findings may reveal the anti-arrhythmic potential of K201. The preferential ryanodine receptor stabilizer (K201) possesses antiarrhythmic effects through calcium regulation.  The drug K201 (JTV-519) increases inotropy and suppresses arrhythmias in failing hearts, but the effects of K201 on normal hearts is unknown.  K201 fails to prevent DADs in RyR2(R4496C+/-) myocytes and ventricular arrhythmias in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice In vivo administration of K201 failed to prevent induction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice. The 1,4-benzothiazepine JTV519, which increases the binding affinity of calstabin-2 for RyR2, inhibited the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans and triggered arrhythmias. In arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-/- mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2+/- mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstablin2.  In three models of arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2(-/-) mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2(+/-) mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstabin2.  A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias.  JTV-519 had significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, mainly by increasing effective refractory period, suggesting that it may have potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation. JTV-519 significantly decreased the mean number of sustained atrial fibrillation episodes (from 4.2 +/- 2.9 to 0 +/- 0, P < 0.01).  We conclude that JTV-519 can exert antiarrhythmic effects against AF by inhibiting repolarizing K(+) currents.

{"question": "Is Propofol used for short-term sedation?", "context": "The current study explores the incidence and content of dreaming during short-term sedation with sevoflurane or propofo Propofol is the sedative most frequently used for short-term sedation and the weaning phase, whereas benzodiazepines are the preferred substances for medium- and long-term sedation. Performance of the A-line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and of the Bispectral Index (BIS) at assessing depth of short-term sedation following cardiac surgery. All patients received sedation with propofol according to the study protocol. Short-term sedation with either sevoflurane using ACD or propofol did not negatively affect renal function postoperatively. Assessing feasibility and physiological effects of sedation with sevoflurane, administered with the anesthetic conserving device (AnaConDa), in comparison with propofol and remifentanil. Sevoflurane can be effectively and safely used for short-term sedation of ICU patients with stable hemodynamic conditions. Propofol was used for most of the patients during short-term sedation (57%) and during weaning (48%).

This prospective, clinical trial evaluated the effects of short-term propofol administration on triglyceride levels and serum pancreatic enzymes in children undergoing sedation for magnetic resonance imaging. Dexmedetomidine vs. propofol for short-term sedation of postoperative mechanically ventilated patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and endocrine response of propofol vs. the new alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine for sedation in surgical intensive care patients who need postoperative short-term ventilation. A total of 89 adult, nonemergent, coronary artery bypass graft patients with an expected length of intubation of <24 hrs.

Pharmacokinetics and effects of propofol 6% for short-term sedation in paediatric patients following cardiac surgery. This paper describes the pharmacokinetics and effects of propofol in short-term sedated paediatric patients. Twenty patients who were expected to require 8 h of post-operative sedation and ventilation were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-2.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) or propofol 1-3 mg kg(-1) h(-1) Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol 6% SAZN versus propofol 1% SAZN and Diprivan-10 for short-term sedation following coronary artery bypass surgery. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety characteristics of propofol 6% SAZN were investigated during a short-term infusion and compared with the commercially available product propofol 1% in Intralipid 10% (Diprivan-10) and propofol 1% in Lipofundin MCT/LCT 10% (propofol 1% SAZN). METHODS: In a randomised double-blind study, 24 male patients received a 5-h infusion of propofol at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h for sedation in the immediate postoperative period following coronary artery bypass surgery Propofol infusion and oxycodone-thiopental bolus dosages, titrated to the same sedation end point, resulted in similar time from admission to extubation, although the weaning period was shorter in the propofol group. In terms of breathing pattern, gas exchange, blood gases and haemodynamics, the methods were similar. Propofol, despite its attractive pharmacological profile, may offer no clinical benefit in short-term sedation after a moderate dose fentanyl anaesthesia in cardiac surgery. Postoperative short-term sedation with propofol in cardiac surgery. We conducted a randomized double-blind study to assess the safety and effectiveness of short-term sedation with propofol in adult patients immediately after cardiac surgery. The use of propofol for short-term sedation in ICUs has allowed the maintenance of sedation to continue until just a few hours before extubation but the benefits of propofol for longer-term indications are more debatable.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a well-recognized complication of recreational cocaine use. ICH is more common in those currently using cocaine perhaps because of acute spikes in blood pressure. Intracerebral hemorrhage in cocaine users. Cocaine is a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but there are no large studies that have characterized the location, pathology, and outcome of patients with cocaine-associated ICH Aneurysmal SAH may be largely a preventable disease among the young and middle-aged because several prevalent risk factors can be modified by medication (eg, hypertension) or behavioral change (eg, cigarette smoking, cocaine use). Cocaine use and hypertension are major risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in young African Americans. Cocaine use (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.3-11.8), hypertension (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.2-8.7) and alcohol use (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3) were independently associated with increased risk for ICH Cocaine use has been temporally associated with neurovascular complications, including the rupture of intracerebral aneurysms. Chronic cocaine use appears to predispose patients who harbor incidental neurovascular anomalies to present at an earlier point in their natural history than similar non-cocaine users. Acute intoxication with either cocaine or methamphetamine may contribute to formation and rupture of a berry aneurysm by causing transient hypertension and tachycardia. Although the exact mechanism by which berry aneurysms form remains undetermined, research indicates that propagation and rupture of the aneurysm are aggravated by hypertension and tachycardia, both of which are pharmacologic side effects of cocaine and methamphetamine The high frequency of hypertension, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and lacunar infarction among young black patients with stroke suggests accelerated hypertensive arteriolar damage, possibly due to poor control of hypertension. Cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage: analysis of predisposing factors and mechanisms causing hemorrhagic strokes. hypertensive cardiovascular disease (HCVD) was significantly higher in persons with intracerebral hemorrhage than in those with aneurysm rupture. Our findings suggest that HCVD predisposes to cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage Intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse. n view of the present epidemic of cocaine abuse, cocaine toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage An increase in cocaine abuse by pregnant women has been associated with a range of maternal/fetal cardiovascular complications. Intracerebral hemorrhage has been reported as a cocaine-related complication, 13 patients were identified with neurologic deficits attributable to the use of cocaine. Ischemic manifestations were the most frequent, occurring in seven (54%) patients, with a mean age of 34.2 years. Three (23%) patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage, and three (23%) had intracerebral hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: An association between cocaine use and stroke has been reported, but few studies have examined cocaine-related neurovascular disease using modern stroke diagnostic techniques. OBJECTIVE: Cocaine is a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but there are no large studies that have characterized the location, pathology, and outcome of patients with cocaine-associated ICH. Because cocaine and ecstasy abuse has been reported to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke and fatal brain hemorrhage, thromboaspiration may be an alternative therapy to thrombolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal SAH may be largely a preventable disease among the young and middle-aged because several prevalent risk factors can be modified by medication (eg, hypertension) or behavioral change (eg, cigarette smoking, cocaine use). OBJECTIVE: The use of cocaine has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease specially in young adults. Cocaine hydrochloride causes mainly intracerebral and subarachnoidal bleeding, while crack (freebase) causes intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic infarctions with equal frequency. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate cocaine use as a significant risk factor for fatal brain hemorrhage and may explain, in part, the increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in some drug-using cohorts. Abuse of amphetamine, cocaine and related compounds has become an important risk factor for intracerebral haemorrhage in young adults.

Here, we explored the complement-mediated anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive tumor cells of various histological origins. ays. In this study, we report that an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (HER2Mab), which blocks HER2 dimerization with HER3, induces HER3 dimerization with EGFR in both low and high HER2 expressing cancer cells. Recent evidence from both basic and clinical studies suggests that ERBB3 (HER3) serves as a key activator of downstream signaling through dimerization with other ERBB proteins and plays a critical role in the widespread clinical resistance to EGFR and HER2 targeting cancer therapies.  HER3 intracellular domains play a crucial role in HER3/HER2 dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways. Dimerization among the EGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors leads to allosteric activation of the kinase domains of the partners. Our results show that quantification of HER dimerization provides information about receptor activation that cannot be obtained by quantification of single receptors.  Pertuzumab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) dimerization. It was recently approved by the US FDA for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  he HER dimerization status may be more important than HER receptor expression per se in determining sensitivity or resistance to a given therapeutic agen  and HER2 dimerization inhibitors One of the mechanisms by which tumor cell proliferation can be inhibited consists in hampering HER2 dimerization by targeting its extracellular domain with specific antibodies.

{"question": "Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.", "context": "Children receiving clonidine immediately after anesthesia induction had statistically significant improvement in postoperative agitation at the 15-minute mark (P = .096) and last score obtained (P = .095) using the Watcha scale. Clonidine has proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of post-operative agitation at a higher dose (3 and 2 μg kg⁻¹). Post-anaesthetic agitation was observed in two patients (6.6%) in group 1, eight patients (26.6%) in group 2 as compared to 12 patients (40%) in group 3 after 15 min of post-operative observation. The mean scores in group 1 at 15 and 30 min were significantly lower than those in group 3 (P value <0.05) Caudal clonidine at a lower dose (1 μg kg⁻¹) could be effective in reducing the incidence of sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation in children undergoing urogenital and lower limb surgery without any significant adverse effects. Only the 4 microg kg-1 dose of clonidine was associated with a significant reduction in emergence agitation. Fewer children in the clonidine 4 microg kg-1 group displayed agitation (25%) than in the midazolam group (60%) (P=0.025). In comparison with midazolam, clonidine 4 microg kg-1 reduced sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation without increasing postoperative side-effects. Prophylactic use of clonidine against sevoflurane-induced agitation may represent a new and promising application. One hundred and twenty children were included in this study: 59 of whom received clonidine, and 61 placebo; 41% of those in the placebo group exhibited moderate-severe EA compared with only 22% of those in the clonidine group (P < 0.03). Findings demonstrate that i.v. clonidine administered after induction of anesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of EA in young children, but is associated with sleepiness postoperatively. Clonidine could not prevent agitation (incidence 54%, 13/24) Clonidine 1.5 microg/kg did not differ from placebo with respect to postoperative agitation. Clonidine is effective in treating sevoflurane-induced postanesthesia agitation in children. Pain and discomfort scores were significantly decreased in the clonidine group; the incidence of agitation was reduced by 57% (P = 0.029) and the incidence of severe agitation by 67% (P = 0.064). Relative risks for developing agitation and severe agitation were 0.43 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.78) and 0.32 (0.09-1.17), respectively. Clonidine produces a substantial reduction in the risk of postsevoflurane agitation in children. Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. Clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 prevented agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia, independently of the route of administration. The effect of clonidine appears to be dose-dependent, as an epidural dose of 1 microgram kg-1 failed to reduce it. Clonidine prevents sevoflurane-induced agitation in children. In 16 placebo and 2 clonidine-treated patients agitation was observed (P < 0.001) In 6 patients of the Placebo group, agitation was graded as severe, whereas none of the patients in the Clonidine group developed severe agitation (P = 0.02). We conclude that clonidine effectively prevents agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia. Clonidine 2 microg/kg IV after anesthetic induction effectively reduces the incidence of agitation without resulting in clinically relevant bradycardia and hypotension. Children receiving clonidine prior to undergoing strabismus surgery have a small but noticeable reduction in postoperative agitation, stay slightly longer in the post-anesthesia care unit, and have higher rates of parent satisfaction. We report three cases of preoperative use of intranasal clonidine in pediatric patients, all for different indications. One patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hallucinations associated with oral midazolam. One patient was given clonidine as a premedicant. The third patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hypertension. All three patients had subjective resolution of indicated symptoms and none experienced adverse outcomes.

{"question": "Is there an association between presenteeism and depression?", "context": "Presenteeism was positively associated with severity of depression (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, P < 0.0001; WPAI, P < 0.0001). Statistically significant correlations (0.32-0.53) were found between presenteeism and increasing disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life.  Presenteeism was associated with increasing fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Factors with less contribution to presenteeism included physical limitations, depression or anxiety, inadequate job training, and problems with supervisors and coworkers.  BACKGROUND: Subthreshold depression is highly prevalent in the general population and causes great loss to society especially in the form of reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism). Two major causes of worker presenteeism (reduced on-the-job productivity as a result of health problems) are musculoskeletal pain and mental health issues, particularly depression.   Pain and depression were significantly associated with presenteeism. Pr Survey adjusted multivariable logistic regression assessed classification of 12-month, depression-related presenteeism on the basis of socio-demographic, financial, work and health factors.  RESULTS: The LPT from absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced performance while present at work) was significantly higher among the MDD group. BACKGROUND: Depression is reported to be a major cause of illness-related sub-optimal work performance (presenteeism).  BACKGROUND: It is amply documented that mood disorders adversely affect job satisfaction, workforce productivity, and absenteeism/presenteeism.  The difference in productivity loss due to impaired presenteeism was significantly different between the two groups, but the productivity loss due to absenteeism was not.  Disease activity (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.11-9.48) and depression (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.22-8.48) were associated with absenteeism, while depression (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.77-18.27, disease activity (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.76-8.98), anxiety (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.83-8.31), self-efficacy (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.86), and increasing age (OR 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.00-1.08) were associated with presenteeism.  Depression, in particular, appears to be associated with employment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, and should therefore be prioritized in clinical practice. Depression frequently causes unemployment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, which results in significantly reduced productivity. Presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group at each time point (p < or = .001). In cross-sectional models, presenteeism was associated with more severe depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, the interaction ofpsychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r2 range = .33-.54). Chronic conditions such as depression/anxiety, obesity, arthritis, and back/neck pain are especially important causes of productivity loss. Comorbidities have significant non-additive effects on both absenteeism and presenteeism. RESULTS: At baseline, all presenteeism measures were sensitive to differences between those with (N=69) and without (N=363) depression/anxiety. Depression and anxiety were more consistently associated with \"presenteeism\" (that is, lost productivity while at work) than with absenteeism, whether this was measured by cutback days or by direct questionnaires. RESULTS: Substantial research exists about anxiety and depression costs, such as performance and productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, physical disability exacerbation, mental health treatment, increased medical care costs, exacerbating of physical illness, and studies of mental health care limitations and cost-offset. The author discusses the etiology and potential solutions for managing this new component in the productivity equation and in addressing depression, the major contributor to presenteeism. For employees who are currently depressed, recent research evidence has demonstrated that pharmacotherapy can have a dramatic and positive effect on lost productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Among participants who were still employed, those with depression had significantly more job turnover, presenteeism, and absenteeism.  Only depression affected both absenteeism-presenteeism and critical incidents.  CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders in the workplace persist over time and have a major effect on work performance, most notably on \"presenteeism,\" or reduced effectiveness in the workplace.  The negative effects of depression include those on patients' occupational functioning, including absenteeism, presenteeism, and reduced opportunities for educational and work success.  The remitted group demonstrated a significant improvement in productivity (particularly presenteeism) when compared with the new visit group (Z = -3.29, p = 0.001). Depression in workers leads to significant absenteeism, \"presenteeism\" (diminished capacity due to illness while still present at work), and significantly increased medical expenses in addition to the costs of psychiatric care.  Significant predictors of presenteeism and activity impairment at follow-up (controlled for gender, age, spondyloarthritis subgroups and presenteeism at baseline) were presenteeism at baseline, poor quality of life, worse disease activity, decreased physical function, lower self-efficacy pain and symptom, higher scores of anxiety, depression, smoking and low education level, and for activity impairment also female sex.  \" Pain and depression were significantly associated with presenteeism.

Test drugs investigated in this study were atazanavir and indinavir, which are associated with hyperbilirubinemia and elevations in serum transaminase; ritonavir and nelfinavir, which are not associated with hyperbilirubinemia; and bromfenac, troglitazone, and trovafloxacin, which are associated with severe idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity exhibiting elevations in serum bilirubin and transaminase. Test drugs investigated in this study were atazanavir and indinavir, which are associated with hyperbilirubinemia and elevations in serum transaminase; ritonavir and nelfinavir, which are not associated with hyperbilirubinemia; and bromfenac, troglitazone, and trovafloxacin, which are associated with severe idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity exhibiting elevations in serum bilirubin and transaminase. Due to limited solubility and poor ionization of bilirubin and its glucuronide, the formation of estradiol 3-glucuronide was used as a surrogate to assess UGT1A1 activity, while the transport of pitavastatin, CDCF, and taurocholate were used as surrogate probe substrates to monitor the function of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP, respectively. In vitro, faldaprevir inhibited key processes involved in bilirubin clearance: UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (UGT1A1) (IC50 0.45 µM), which conjugates bilirubin, and hepatic uptake and efflux transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (IC50 0.57 µM), OATP1B3 (IC50 0.18 µM), and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 (IC50 6.2 µM), which transport bilirubin and its conjugates. In vitro OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition is associated with observations of benign clinical unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 3.  The results indicated that in vivo Fi values >0.2 or R-values >1.5 for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, but not UGT1A1, are associated with previously reported clinical cases of drug-induced unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. OATP1B1 and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bilirubin was confirmed and inhibition was determined for atazanavir, rifampicin, indinavir, amprenavir, cyclosporine, rifamycin SV and saquinavir.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Lactase deficiency not associated with intestinal inflammation or injury is common in autistic children and may contribute to abdominal discomfort, pain and observed aberrant behavior. Autistic behavior is often accompanied by numerous disturbing symptoms on the part of gastrointestinal system, such as abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. Information on children's stool patterns and gut symptoms collected by questionnaire at 4 weeks and at 6, 18, 30 and 42 months of age were available for 12,984 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) Comparison of the ASD and control group during the first 3.5 years of life showed no major differences in stool colour or consistency, or in frequency of diarrhoea, constipation, bloody stools or abdominal pain. Constipation is a frequent finding in children with gastrointestinal symptoms and autism, particularly in the rectosigmoid colon, often with acquired megarectum. The absence of any correlation between the clinical history and the degree of fecal impaction in autistic children confirms the importance of an abdominal radiograph in the assessment of their degree of constipation. In a sample of 137 children, age 24-96 months, classified as having autism or ASD by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic, 24 percent had a history of at least one chronic gastrointestinal symptom.

{"question": "Is Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure?", "context": "In human hypertrophy, both CaMKII and PKA functionally regulate RyR2 and may induce SR Ca(2+) leak. In the transition from hypertrophy to HF, the diastolic Ca(2+) leak increases and disturbed Ca(2+) cycling occurs. This is associated with an increase in CaMKII- but not PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation. CaMKII inhibition may thus reflect a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological. CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription. In the recent years, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was suggested to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure but also with arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart. Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a central mediator of cardiac stress responses which may serve several critical roles in the regulation of cardiac rhythm, cardiac contractility and growth. Sustained and excessive activation of CaMKII during cardiac disease has, however, been linked to arrhythmias, and maladaptive cardiac remodeling, eventually leading to heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death.  Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. From recent studies, it appears evident that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in the arrhythmogenic processes in heart failure by sensing intracellular Ca(2+) and redox stress, affecting individual ion channels and thereby leading to electrical instability in the heart.  CaMKII activation is proarrhythmic in heart failure where myocardium is stretched. The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is up-regulated in heart failure and has been shown to cause I(Na) gating changes that mimic those induced by a point mutation in humans that is associated with combined long QT and Brugada syndromes. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Na(V)1.5 at multiple sites (including Thr-594 and Ser-516) appears to be required to evoke loss-of-function changes in gating that could contribute to acquired Brugada syndrome-like effects in heart failure. Because CaMKII expression and activity are increased in cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and during arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart a clinical significance of CaMKII is implied. The multifunctional Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is now recognized to play a central role in pathological events in the cardiovascular system. CaMKII has diverse downstream targets that promote vascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, so improved understanding of CaMKII signaling has the potential to lead to new therapies for cardiovascular disease. In our opinion, the multifunctional Ca and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a molecule to watch, in part because a solid body of accumulated data essentially satisfy Koch's postulates, showing that the CaMKII pathway is a core mechanism for promoting myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Multiple groups have now confirmed the following: (1) that CaMKII activity is increased in hypertrophied and failing myocardium from animal models and patients; (2) CaMKII overexpression causes myocardial hypertrophy and HF and (3) CaMKII inhibition (by drugs, inhibitory peptides and gene deletion) improves myocardial hypertrophy and HF  In contrast, inhibiting the CaMKII pathway appears to reduce arrhythmias and improve myocardial responses to pathological stimuli.  In this review, we discuss the important role of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the regulation of RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release. In particular, we examine how pathological activation of CaMKII can lead to an increased risk of sudden arrhythmic death. Finally, we discuss how reduction of CaMKII-mediated RyR2 hyperactivity might reduce the risk of arrhythmias and may serve as a rationale for future pharmacotherapeutic approaches. Transgenic (TG) Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) δ(C) mice develop systolic heart failure (HF). CaMKII regulates intracellular Ca(2+) handling proteins as well as sarcolemmal Na(+) channels. We hypothesized that CaMKII also contributes to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias via augmentation of the late Na(+) current (late I(Na)) in early HF (8-week-old TG mice). Thus, late I(Na) inhibition appears to be a promising option for diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias in HF where CaMKII is found to be increased. We tested the hypothesis that increased RyR2 phosphorylation by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is both necessary and sufficient to promote lethal ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: our results suggest that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation of RyR2 Ca(2+) release channels at S2814 plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death in mice with heart failure. Excessive activation of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for CaMKII-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain. Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. We hypothesized that CaMKII contributes to arrhythmias and underlying cellular events and that inhibition of CaMKII reduces cardiac arrhythmogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that CaMKII contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in TG CaMKIIdelta(C) mice having heart failure and suggest the increased SR Ca leak as an important mechanism. Moreover, CaMKII inhibition reduces cardiac arrhythmias in vitro and in vivo and may therefore indicate a potential role for future antiarrhythmic therapies warranting further studies. Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can phosphorylate RyR2 and modulate its activity. This phosphorylation positively modulates cardiac inotropic function but in extreme situations such as heart failure, elevated CaMKII activity can adversely increase Ca2+ release from the SR and lead to arrhythmogenesis.  Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase expressed abundantly in the heart. CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Under stress conditions, excessive CaMKII activity promotes heart failure and arrhythmias, in part through actions at Ca(2+) homeostatic proteins. Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was recently shown to alter Na(+) channel gating and recapitulate a human Na(+) channel genetic mutation that causes an unusual combined arrhythmogenic phenotype in patients: simultaneous long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. CaMKII is upregulated in heart failure where arrhythmias are common, and CaMKII inhibition can reduce arrhythmias. Thus, CaMKII-dependent channel modulation may contribute to acquired arrhythmic disease.  In heart failure (HF), Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) expression is increased. Altered Na(+) channel gating is linked to and may promote ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in HF. Calmodulin regulates Na(+) channel gating, in part perhaps via CaMKII. Thus, CaMKII-dependent regulation of Na(+) channel function may contribute to arrhythmogenesis in HF. Recent findings that CaMKII expression in the heart changes during hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and infarction suggest that CaMKII may be a viable therapeutic target for patients suffering from common forms of heart disease.  Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias.

Ethanolic extract of Tricosanthes dioica Roxb plant caused a significant lowering of blood sugar in fasted rats and depressed the peak value in glucose loaded single and longterm fed groups of rats. The ethanolic extract of the aerial part of T. dioica also induced significant depression in the peak values in the glucose loaded models. The amount of sucrose in ordinary marinated foods, such as herring, cucumber, and common beet was negligible Dietary saponins of sea cucumber ameliorate obesity, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance in high-fat diet-fed mice. In this study, we investigated the effects of saponins of sea cucumber (SSC) on high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Mice administrated with 0.1% SSC had significantly decreased serum glucose and insulin levels, lower homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index, and area under the blood glucose curve, suggesting that insulin sensitivity is enhanced by dietary SSC. [Effects of sea cucumber cerebroside and its long-chain base on lipid and glucose metabolism in obese mice]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sea cucumber cerebroside(SCC) and its long-chain base(LCB) on lipid and glucose metabolism in obese mice. CONCLUSIONS: Sea cucumber cerebroside and its long-chain base can improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in obese mice. The hitherto unknown glucose regulating role of three vegetable peels from cucurbitaceae family was evaluated. In a preliminary study, effects of ethanolic extracts of Cucurbita pepo, Cucumis sativus and Praecitrullus fistulosus peels were studied at 250 and 500 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 15 days in the alterations in serum glucose and in hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) in male mice. All the three peel extracts nearly reversed most of these changes induced by alloxan suggesting their possible role in ameliorating diabetes mellitus and related changes in serum lipids. Antidiabetic activity of aqueous fruit extract of Cucumis trigonus Roxb. in streptozotocin-induced-diabetic rats. Cucumis trigonus Roxb. (Cucurbitaceae) fruit is used in the Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Based on a number of reports on the blood glucose level reduction and the other complications of diabetes associated with some Cucurbitaceae plants, the antidiabetic effect of Cucumis trigonus fruit was investigated. The antidiabetic activity of aqueous extract of Cucumis trigonus fruit was evaluated by using normal and streptozotocin-induced-diabetic rats. The aqueous fruit extract of Cucumis trigonus has had beneficial effects in reducing the elevated blood glucose level and lipid profile of STZ-induced-diabetic rats. Possible amelioration of atherogenic diet induced dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism and hyperglycemia by the peel extracts of Mangifera indica, Cucumis melo and Citrullus vulgaris fruits in rats. Hitherto unknown efficacy of the peel extracts of Mangifera indica (MI), Cucumis melo (CM) and Citrullus vulgaris (CV) fruits in ameliorating the diet-induced alterations in dyslipidemia, thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus have been investigated in rats. Rats, treated simultaneously with either of the peel extracts reversed the CCT-diet induced increase in the levels of tissue LPO, serum lipids, glucose, creatinine kinase-MB and decrease in the levels of thyroid hormones and insulin indicating their potential to ameliorate the diet induced alterations in serum lipids, thyroid dysfunctions and hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus. Role of pectin from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) in modulation of protein kinase C activity and regulation of glycogen metabolism in rats. The regulatory role of protein kinase C (PKC) in glycogen metabolism in pectin fed rats was investigated. Administration of pectin (5 g/kg body wt/day) from cucumber (Cucumis sativius L.) led to inhibitory effects on PKC activity in the liver of rats. In the brain and pancreas, PKC activity was significantly higher in pectin-treated rats as compared to the control group. Level of blood glucose was significantly lowered and the level of glycogen in the liver was significantly increased in pectin-administered rats. Addition of fermented milk (yogurt) and pickled cucumber to a breakfast with a high-glycemic index bread significantly lowered postprandial glycemia and insulinemia compared with the reference meal. In contrast, addition of regular milk and fresh cucumber had no favorable effect on the metabolic responses. Tolbutamide, Cucurbita ficifolia, Phaseolus vulgaris, Opuntia streptacantha, Spinacea oleracea, Cucumis sativus and Cuminum cyminum decrease significantly the area under the glucose tolerance curve and the hyperglycemic peak. Two unsaturated fatty acids with potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity purified from the body wall of sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus). In this study, 2 fatty acids with strong α-glucosidase-inhibitory activity, 7(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 7(Z),10(Z)-octadecadienoic acid, were purified and identified from sea cucumber.

{"question": "Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?", "context": "The apoptosis of the MSCs was induced by subjecting the cells to OGD conditions for 4 h and was detected by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst 33258 staining.  In addition to the antimicrobial activity, we found that treatment of the cancer cell lines, Jurkat T-cells, Granta cells, and melanoma cells, with the Pseudomonas sp. In5 crude extract increased staining with the apoptotic marker Annexin V while no staining of healthy normal cells, i.e., naïve or activated CD4 T-cells, was observed. At the same time, the expressions of CD105, CD31, and the apoptotic marker of Annexin V were detected through flow cytometry for analyzing the relationship between the expression of cell surface markers and biological behavior. However, we found decreased sperm concentration, increase of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and increased binding of apoptotic marker annexin V.  hCG enhanced viability of granulosa-lutein cells through antiapoptosis but not proliferation, because the apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased, but the proliferative markers of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were not increased. However, as the DOTAP concentration increased from 50 to 800 microM, the apoptotic marker Annexin V and ROS double positive cells increased, suggesting that high dose of DOTAP-generated ROS causes cell apoptosis.  Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus netilmicin, ANOVA, P<0.05). he apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased the apoptotic marker Annexin V Annexin V labels apoptotic neurons following hypoxia-ischemia. In the present study, the apoptotic cell population was identified immunocytochemically using Annexin V, a marker of cells in an early stage of apoptosis. Use of annexin V antibody to identify apoptotic cells during pregnancy. Only few SF Treg cells were apoptotic, as indicated by limited annexin V staining of these cells. Eosinophils 'aged' in vitro for 48 h exhibited endonuclease DNA degradation, apoptotic morphology, increased red autofluorescence and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) as assessed by binding of FITC-labelled annexin V. In vivo detection of apoptotic cells with fluorescently labeled annexin V is an emerging technique that we evaluated for detecting apoptotic germ cells in a mouse model of testicular torsion.Annexin V labeled with an indocyanine fluorophore (bisfunctional succinimidyl ester of cyanine 5.5) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) was injected intravenously in mice 18 hours after the repair of unilateral 720-degree testicular torsion for 2 hours Here, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced endothelial apoptotic microparticles and decreased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels might contribute to the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in cardiovascular disease.Flow cytometry was used to assess endothelial cell apoptosis and circulating EPC levels by quantification of circulating CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticles and EPC markers (defined as KDRCD133, CD34CD133, CD34KDR) in peripheral blood.In total, 125 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study, of whom 80 patients (64%) were with normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of &lt;20 microg/min, overnight urine samples), 35 patients (28%) with microalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate of 20-200 microg/min), and 10 patients (8%) with macroalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate >200 microg/min). Surfactant protein A (SP-A) binds to phosphatidylserine and competes with annexin V binding on late apoptotic cells Targeting of apoptotic macrophages and experimental atheroma with radiolabeled annexin V: a technique with potential for noninvasive imaging of vulnerable plaque Because annexin V has a high affinity for exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, radiolabeled annexin V may be used for noninvasive detection of apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions.Atherosclerotic plaques were produced in 5 rabbits by deendothelialization of the infradiaphragmatic aorta followed by 12 weeks of cholesterol diet; 5 controls were studied without manipulation Apoptotic abscess imaging with 99mTc-HYNIC-rh-Annexin-V. Synthesis and evaluation of a 18F-labelled recombinant annexin-V derivative, for identification and quantification of apoptotic cells with PET. Sensitive and visible detection of apoptotic cells on Annexin-V modified substrate using aminophenylboronic acid modified gold nanoparticles (APBA-GNPs) labeling. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of the early apoptosis marker Annexin V and for nuclear staining by 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) revealed different extents of apoptosis versus non-apoptotic cell death for the three agents. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an convenient marker for apoptotic cells. DR5 expression was elevated and associated with the apoptotic marker annexin V. Apoptosis was reduced in CD4(+) T cells when cultured with anti-DR5 antibody. Flow cytometric analysis using the apoptotic marker, Annexin V, shows that this endogenous re-expression is sufficient to drive the SCLC cells to apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by staining nuclei with propidium iodide and phosphatidylserine (a marker of early apoptotic events) with Annexin V as well as by DNA fragmentation assay. Decreased cell growth was not caused by cell death as BEL exposure did not alter nuclear morphology or increase annexin V (apoptotic cell marker) or propidium iodide (necrotic cell marker) staining after 48 h. Four populations of cells can be identified: region R1: vital cells (annexin V negative/PI negative), region R2: apoptotic cells (annexin V positive/PI negative), region R3: dead cells (annexin V positive/ PI positive); and region R4: damaged cells (annexin V negative/PI positive). Furthermore, uptake of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V by tumors correlated with apoptotic index (r = 0.87, P = 0.02). Annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells were characterized as early apoptotic, Annexin V(+)/PI(+) as late apoptotic and Annexin V(-)/PI(+) as dead. Targeting ability of Annexin V for apoptotic macrophages was kept and enhanced. [18F]annexin V accumulated in the infarct area of the left ventricle, where apoptotic cells were observed. The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, TUNEL assay, and Annexin V-Cy3, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry, and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR.  Furthermore, hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3. The procedure delivers two sperm fractions: annexin V-negative (nonapoptotic) and annexin V-positive (apoptotic). The percentage of cells stained with annexin V, an early apoptotic marker, increased dramatically after cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin D compared with non-cytochalasin-D-treated controls (P<0.05).  Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA.  We have coupled annexin V with the bifunctional hydrazinonicotinamide reagent (HYNIC) to prepare technetium-99m HYNIC-annexin V and demonstrated localization of radioactivity in tissues undergoing apoptosis in vivo. In conlusion, these studies confirm the value of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V uptake as a marker for the detection and quantification of apoptotic cells in vivo. The application of Annexin V labeling at electron microscopy will allow a more refined description of the morphological events occurring during apoptosis.

{"question": "Is there an association between Muenke Syndrome and FGFR3 gene mutation?", "context": "RESULTS: Forty-four with a positive FGFR3 mutation, median age 9 years, range 7 months to 52 years were enrolled. In addition, 10 unaffected siblings served as controls (5 males, 5 females; median age, 13 years; range, 3-18 years). Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3)-associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990 s.  The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product.  Muenke syndrome caused by point mutation (C749G) in the FGFR3 gene affects 1 in 30,000 newborns and accounts for 25% to 30% of genetic causes of craniosynostosis. Phenotypic variability in two families of Muenke syndrome with FGFR3 mutation. PURPOSE: There are a number of craniosynostosis syndromes with hearing loss-including Muenke, Apert, Pfeiffer, Crouzon, Beare-Stevenson, Crouzon with acanthosis nigricans, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes-that result from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene. Talocalcaneal coalition in Muenke syndrome: report of a patient, review of the literature in FGFR-related craniosynostoses, and consideration of mechanism. To better understand the pathophysiology of the Muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for Muenke syndrome (FgfR3 (P244R)) and compare them with human phenotypes. We show in this study that knock-in mice harboring the mutation responsible for the Muenke syndrome (FgfR3(P244R)) display postnatal shortening of the cranial base along with synchondrosis growth plate dysfunction characterized by loss of resting, proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones and decreased Ihh expression. Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. Epilepsy in Muenke syndrome: FGFR3-related craniosynostosis. Muenke syndrome (FGFR3-related craniosynostosis): expansion of the phenotype and review of the literature. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. PURPOSE: The Muenke syndrome mutation (FGFR3 (P250R)), which was discovered 15 years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation. The heterozygous Pro250Arg substitution mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which increases ligand-dependent signalling, is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans and defines Muenke syndrome. P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a Pro250Arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. In addition, sensorineural hearing loss is detected in all FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice as in the majority of Muenke syndrome patients. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation or chromosomal abnormality in ∼ 21% of cases, but it is likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered.To identify a shared signature of genetically determined craniosynostosis by comparing the expression patterns in three monogenic syndromes with a control group of patients with non-syndromic sagittal synostosis.Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured The craniosynostosis syndromes: Apert syndrome, Beare-Stevenson syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can be caused by mutation in either FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 Identical proline-->arginine gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 (Pro252Arg), FGFR2 (Pro253Arg) and FGFR3 (Pro250Arg), result in type I Pfeiffer, Apert and Muenke craniosynostosis syndromes, respectively The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes Mutation analysis of FGFR-3 revealed a missense mutation in exon 6, c.749 C>G, with a resultant amino acid change from proline to arginine at codon 250 (P250R), in keeping with Muenke syndrome (Am J Hum Genet 1997;60:555-564) In an attempt to delineate functional features separating SCS from Muenkes syndrome, we screened patients presenting with coronal suture synostosis for mutations in the TWIST 1 gene, and for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis Mutations in the gene that encodes Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Achondroplasia (MIM 100800), Hypochondroplasia (MIM 146000), Muenke Syndrome (MIM 602849), Thanatophoric Dysplasia (MIM 187600, MIM 187601) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital Syndrome (MIM 149730).Here we report a clinical and molecular study in a large cohort of 125 Portuguese patients with these skeletal disorders.  The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.  P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities.  METHODS: Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).  In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease.  Skeletal analysis of the Fgfr3(P244R) mouse, a genetic model for the Muenke craniosynostosis syndrome. Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Epilepsy in Muenke syndrome: FGFR3-related craniosynostosis.

{"question": "Do histone variant mH2A (macro-H2A) levels decrease upon differentiation?", "context": "Through manipulation of macroH2A isoforms, we further demonstrate that macroH2A2 is the predominant barrier to reprogramming. In particular, we find macroH2A isoforms to be highly enriched at target genes of the K27me3 demethylase, Utx, which are reactivated early in iPS reprogramming  Therefore, we propose that macroH2A isoforms provide a redundant silencing layer or terminal differentiation 'lock' at critical pluripotency genes that presents as an epigenetic barrier when differentiated cells are challenged to reprogram. Histone variant macroH2A confers resistance to nuclear reprogramming Resistance to reprogramming is associated with incorporation of the histone variant macroH2A, which is retained on the Xi of differentiated cells, but absent from the Xi of EpiSCs. We highlight the role of macroH2A in the establishment and maintenance of differentiated states and we discuss its still poorly recognized function in transcriptional activation. Histone variant macroH2A marks embryonic differentiation in vivo and acts as an epigenetic barrier to induced pluripotency. MacroH2A.1 was found to be present at low levels upon the establishment of pluripotency in the inner cell mass and epiblast, but it was highly enriched in the trophectoderm and differentiated somatic cells later in mouse development. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that macroH2A.1 is incorporated in the chromatin of regulatory regions of pluripotency genes in somatic cells such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult neural stem cells, but not in embryonic stem cells. In addition, overexpression of macroH2A isoforms prevented efficient reprogramming of epiblast stem cells to naïve pluripotency.  Macro histone variants are critical for the differentiation of human pluripotent cells Here we show that the knockdown of macro histone variants impaired the in vitro and in vivo differentiation of human pluripotent cells, likely through defects in the silencing of pluripotency-related genes Furthermore, male and female mH2A-deficient ESCs proliferate normally under pluripotency culture conditions, and respond to several standard differentiation procedures efficiently.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}
{"question": "Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?", "context": "It seems likely that continued study of the methylation of H4K20 will yield extremely valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene expression. Aberrant rereplication correlates with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Consistent with this, H4K20 methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. H4K20 methylation regulates quiescence and chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 in quiescence.  Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells. Histone H4 lysine 20 methylation: key player in epigenetic regulation of genomic integrity.  Intense research during the past few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance.  Both H4K20 mono-methylation and H3K56 acetylation mark transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). These results together indicate that H4K20me1 as well as H3K56Ac are bona fide marks for transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 by PR-Set7 ensures the integrity of late replicating sequence domains in Drosophila. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7  We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

Several mutations seen in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) give rise to the formation of hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria, a considerable risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, by leading to enzymatic inactivation. At admission, he had significantly elevated plasma and urine levels of total homocysteine, significantly decreased levels of folate in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and a normal blood concentration of methionine. Response to treatment demonstrated B(6)-non-responsive homocystinuria. Molecular study showed compound heterozygous T353 N and D444 N mutations of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme in the regulation of plasma homocysteine levels. MTHFR deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocystinuria and hypomethioninaemia and presents with highly variable symptoms affecting many organs but predominantly the central nervous system.  Some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. Rare mutations in the MTHFR gene have been associated with autosomal recessive MTHFR deficiency leading to homocystinuria. Characterization of six novel mutations in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in patients with homocystinuria. Five patients suspected of having non-classical homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency were examined with respect to their symptoms, MTHFR enzyme activity and genotypes of the MTHFR gene. The results of our study render the full-length characterisation of affected alleles in severe homocystinuria and moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia due to MTHFR deficiency and provide a basis for investigating the regulation of the human MTHFR gene. Our cloning of the MTHFR coding sequence was initially followed by the identification of the first deleterious mutations in MTHFR, in patients with homocystinuria and marked hyperhomocysteinemia. Different MTHFR mutations lead either to severe homocystinuria as a multisystem disorder or to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is a common risk factor for disorders ranging from cardiovasculopathy to spina bifida.

Betaine for treatment of homocystinuria caused by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Severe deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with homocystinuria can result in early demise or later-onset neurological impairment, including developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and seizures.  Deficiency of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) leads to deficient remethylation of homocysteine and is one of the causes of homocystinuria.

{"question": "Does the histone chaperone ASF1 interact with histones H1/H2?", "context": "The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4. The central histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 comprises a highly conserved globular core and a divergent C-terminal tail.  The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms.  An ASF1-EGFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus. By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners.   This inhibition requires Asf1 binding to H3-H4 and Rtt109 KAT activity, but not tail acetylation of H3-H4 or K56 acetylation of H3.  Asf1 is a conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone that can assemble and disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation.  Here we characterize further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Asf1 and Set2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H3/H4 posttranslational modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf1 and Set2, and cooccurrence of Asf1 and Set2 in protein complexes.  Consistent with this possibility, we show that Asf1 stimulates Set2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf1 binding to H3/H4.  Drosophila histones H3 and H4 can also be produced as a soluble (H3H4)(2) heterotetrameric complex if they are co-expressed with the histone chaperone Asf1. Structure and function of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 complexed with histones H3 and H4. Newly synthesized histones H3-H4 first bind histone chaperone Asf1 and are then transferred to other chaperones for nucleosome assembly The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4 Histone chaperone Asf1 is required for histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation, a modification associated with S phase in mitosis and meiosis Antisilencing function 1 (ASF1) is a major histone H3-H4 chaperone that deposits histones H3 and H4 onto DNA Rtt109, a recently discovered histone acetyltransferase (HAT) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, functions with the histone chaperone Asf1 to acetylate lysine K56 on histone H3 (H3K56), a modification associated with newly synthesized histones In this issue of Cell, English et al. present the first crystal structure of a histone chaperone (Asf1) bound to histones (the H3/H4 heterodimer) By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners. Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) is a highly conserved chaperone of histones H3/H4 that assembles or disassembles chromatin during transcription, replication, and repair. Analysis of a panel of Asf1 mutations that modulate the ability of Asf1 to bind to histones H3/H4 demonstrates that the histone binding activity of Asf1 is required for the acetylation of Lys-9 and Lys-56 on newly synthesized H3. Thus Rad53 competes with histones H3-H4 and cochaperones HirA/CAF-I for binding to Asf1. Structure and function of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 complexed with histones H3 and H4. Currently, the best-characterized chaperone-histone interaction is that between the ubiquitous chaperone Asf1 and a dimer of H3 and H4.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}
{"question": "Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?", "context": "In addition to RNA synthesis, multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) support enzymatic reactions such as intrinsic transcript cleavage. msRNAP active sites from different species appear to exhibit differential intrinsic transcript cleavage efficiency and have likely evolved to allow fine-tuning of the transcription process. Here we show that a single amino-acid substitution in the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces RNAP II, Rpb1 H1085Y, engenders a gain of intrinsic cleavage activity where the substituted tyrosine appears to participate in acid-base chemistry at alkaline pH for both intrinsic cleavage and nucleotidyl transfer.  The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. Complexes of yeast RNA polymerase II and RNA are substrates for TFIIS-induced RNA cleavage. RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP from NTP. Nascent RNA cleavage by arrested RNA polymerase II does not require upstream translocation of the elongation complex on DNA. Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription.  under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro The RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Factor-dependent transcription elongation involves nascent RNA cleavage. Cleavage was not restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is an RNA polymerase II binding protein that allows bypass of template arrest sites by activating a nascent RNA cleavage reaction. During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II. These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. It is also possible that the transcript cleavage activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme..

{"question": "Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?", "context": "Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including prostate, breast, colon and lung. All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry There is increased interest in the Bn-receptor family because they are frequently over/ectopically expressed by tumors and thus useful as targets for imaging or receptor-targeted-cytotoxicity.  ML-18 is a non-peptide bombesin receptor subtype-3 antagonist which inhibits lung cancer growth.

{"question": "Is there any role of Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons?", "context": "The postnatal functions of the Dlx1&2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons (CINs) are unknown. Here, using conditional Dlx1, Dlx2, and Dlx1&2 knockouts (CKOs), we defined their roles in specific CINs. The CKOs had dendritic, synaptic, and survival defects, affecting even PV+ CINs. We provide evidence that DLX2 directly drives Gad1, Gad2, and Vgat expression, and show that mutants had reduced mIPSC amplitude. In addition, the mutants formed fewer GABAergic synapses on excitatory neurons and had reduced mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, Dlx1/2 CKO had hypoplastic dendrites, fewer excitatory synapses, and reduced excitatory input. We provide evidence that some of these phenotypes were due to reduced expression of GRIN2B (a subunit of the NMDA receptor), a high confidence Autism gene. Thus, Dlx1&2 coordinate key components of CIN postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival. Furthermore, Dlx1/2 CKO had hypoplastic dendrites, fewer excitatory synapses, and reduced excitatory input.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Does prolactinoma increase osteoporosis risk?", "context": "Prolactinoma: A Massive Effect on Bone Mineral Density in a Young Patient. Osteoporosis has been noted to be an issue in postmenopausal women with prolactinomas. This case shows a similar impact on bone health in a young male resulting in low bone mineral density for age based on Z-score. This case report highlights the possible mechanisms for the bone loss in the setting of prolactinoma and the need for assessing bone health in such patients.  Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures.  Prolactinomas are the most common type of functional pituitary tumor. Effective hyperprolactinemia treatment is of great importance, due to its potential deleterious effects including infertility, gonadal dysfunction and osteoporosis.  Prolactinomas cause hypogonadism, infertility, osteoporosis, and tumor mass effects, and are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumor. We present a 22-year-old man with multiple osteoporotic fractures associated with prolactinoma despite the use of teriparatide for 18 months. We emphasize and highlight the importance of hyperprolactinemia and fractures caused by high prolactin levels. OBJECTIVE: Patients with prolactinoma seem to be at high risk for osteopenia.  RESULTS: Compared to the matched controls, BMD of patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma significantly decreased.  CONCLUSION: In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. Data on osteoporotic fractures in hyperprolactinemia are limited. An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status. Prolactinoma presenting as chronic anaemia with osteoporosis: a case report. Six years later, he was evaluated and diagnosed with a prolactinoma and resultant osteoporosis. Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction.

Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) stimulates cAMP signalling and melanin production and enhances DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation.  MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo.

{"question": "Is Tocilizumab effective for Giant-Cell Arteritis?", "context": "Emerging evidence for adjunctive therapy with tocilizumab, methotrexate, aspirin, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins is encouraging and may lead to a more mainstream role for these therapies among patients with GCA.  TNF-α blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis.  OBJECTIVES: Randomised-controlled trials have recently proven the efficacy of the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab (TCZ) in giant cell arteritis (GCA).  CONCLUSIONS: TCZ may exert its therapeutic effects in GCA by increasing the proliferation and activation of Tregs, and by reverting the pathogenic Treg phenotype seen during active disease. Cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab look promising but require validation in further studies.  Therefore, tocilizumab (humanised monoclonal antibody binding the human interleukin-6 receptor) was introduced as a potential salvage therapy with a swift consecutive resolution of the systemic symptoms and stabilization of the ophthalmic lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Although a late effect of steroids pulses cannot be formally ruled out in this dramatic situation, tocilizumab likely offered a decisive effect in preventing bilateral blindness and may have contributed to steroid tapering. Tocilizumab may represent a new early effective second-line treatment option in corticosteroid-resistant anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.  Tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis with corticosteroid-resistant progressive anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab, received weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo with regard to sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with giant-cell arteritis. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the durability of remission and safety of tocilizumab. Two RCTs have evidenced the efficacy of tocilizumab in addition to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).  Recent randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported on the efficacy and safety of abatacept and mostly tocilizumab in inducing and maintaining remission of GCA.  If a biological therapy is indicated, and in light of the data discussed in this review, the first choice would be tocilizumab in GCA and anti-TNF-α agents (mainly infliximab) in TAK. CONCLUSION: TCZ is effective in GCA.
