We found 170 long intervening ncRNAs (lincRNAs), which had single- or multiexonic structures that did not overlap protein-coding transcripts, and about sixty antisense lncRNAs (ancRNAs), which were complementary to protein-coding transcripts We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine learning. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs.

On the basis of this data, the FDA approved denosumab for the treatment of patients whose GCTB is unresectable, or when surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity. Denosumab (Prolia®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody for RANKL, which selectively inhibits osteoclastogenesis, being recently approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at a high or increased risk of fracture by the FDA in the United Sates and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010. Recent phase II clinical trials with denosumab in skeletally mature adolescents over age 12 years and adults with GCTB, have shown both safety and efficacy, leading to its accelerated US FDA approval on 13 June 2013.  Zoledronic acid (ZA), an intravenously administered bisphosphonate, and Denosumab, a subcutaneously administered inhibitor of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL), have already been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their use in treatment of bone metastases. These results led to the approval of denosumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors, including breast cancer. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, denosumab, and teriparatide are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic options.  Several of these therapies have recently been approved by the FDA to treat bone cancer pain (bisphosphonates, denosumab) and others are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials (tanezumab). A fourth agent, denosumab (bone targeted therapy) was also recently approved by the FDA for patients with bone metastasis after showing a reduction in the occurrence of skeletal-related events.  AHRQ published an updated review in March 2012 that summarized the benefits and risks of osteoporosis medications in treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, including bisphosphonates (aledronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid), parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, calcitonin, estrogens (for prevention in postmenopausal women), selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene), and denosumab(approved by the FDA in 2010).  Four new drugs have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval in 2010 and 2011: sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent; cabazitaxel, a novel microtubule inhibitor; abiraterone acetate, a new androgen biosynthesis inhibitor; and denosumab, a bone-targeting agent.  Recently, the US FDA and the EMA approved denosumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody) to treat skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition to these new and emerging therapeutic agents, denosumab was approved for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to solid tumor malignancies, providing an alternative to zoledronic acid.  Recently, denosumab was FDA-approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  In the 2010s to date, an additional 3 antibodies (denosumab, belimumab, ipilimumab) have been approved and one antibody-drug conjugate (brentuximab vedotin) is undergoing regulatory review and may be approved in the US by August 30, 2011.

{"question": "Are transcription and splicing connected?", "context": ", as splicing is often cotranscriptional, a complex picture emerges in which splicing regulation not only depends on the balance of splicing factor binding to their pre-mRNA target sites but also on transcription-associated features such as protein recruitment to the transcribing machinery and elongation kinetics. recent evidence shows that chromatin structure is another layer of regulation that may act through various mechanisms hese span from regulation of RNA polymerase II elongation, which ultimately determines splicing decisions, to splicing factor recruitment by specific histone marks. Chromatin may not only be involved in alternative splicing regulation but in constitutive exon recognition as well Moreover, splicing was found to be necessary for the proper 'writing' of particular chromatin signatures, giving further mechanistic support to functional interconnections between splicing, transcription and chromatin structure. These links between chromatin configuration and splicing raise the intriguing possibility of the existence of a memory for splicing patterns to be inherited through epigenetic modifications. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. upporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. ere we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide We recently showed that cotranscriptional splicing occurs efficiently in Drosophila, In recent years it became apparent that splicing is predominantly cotranscriptional To determine the prevalence of cotranscriptional splicing in Drosophila, we sequenced nascent RNA transcripts from Drosophila S2 cells as well as from Drosophila heads. Eighty-seven percent of the introns assayed manifest >50% cotranscriptional splicing. The remaining 13% are cotranscriptionally spliced poorly or slowly, with ∼3% being almost completely retained in nascent pre-mRNA. We estimate that > or =90% of endogenous yeast splicing is posttranscriptional, consistent with an analysis of posttranscriptional snRNP-associated pre-mRNA. Notably, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, which stalls elongating Pol II, increased cotranscriptional splicing factor accumulation and splicing in parallel. This provides direct evidence for a kinetic link between transcription, splicing factor recruitment and splicing catalysis. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional elongation and splicing can be influenced reciprocally: Elongation rates control alternative splicing and splicing factors can, in turn, modulate pol II elongation. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator PGC-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Following exercise, PYY, ghrelin, and GH were significantly (p < 0.0001) increased by ~11, ~16 and ~813%, respectively. The noted disruption in the typical inverse relationship between ghrelin and PYY following exercise suggests that interaction of these peptides may be at least partially responsible for post-exercise appetite suppression Plasma levels of PYY and GLP-1 were increased by exercise, whereas plasma ghrelin levels were unaffected by exercise These findings suggest ghrelin and PYY may regulate appetite during and after exercise, significant (P < 0.05) interaction effects for hunger, acylated ghrelin, and PYY, indicating suppressed hunger and acylated ghrelin during aerobic and resistance exercise and increased PYY during aerobic exercise 'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels.

{"question": "Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?", "context": "CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid pain syndromes, mood conditions and asthma are common in adolescents and young women with endometriosis. There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Often, such patients are labelled with irritable bowel syndrome.  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm Hg (95% CI 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm Hg (95% CI 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm Hg (95% CI 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.03-3.87)]. A weak association between reported family history of endometriosis and history of irritable bowel syndrome and the development of endometriosis was also observed.  Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation in patients with endometriosis. Fifteen per cent of the patients with endometriosis also had IBS and 14% of the patients with endometriosis had functional constipation without IBS. CONCLUSION: In patients with endometriosis, 29% also had IBS or constipation.  Seventy-six women (21.4%) had previously been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and 79% of them had endometriosis confirmed. Compared with controls, women with endometriosis had increased risks of abdominopelvic pain (OR 5.2 [95% CI: 4.7-5.7]), dysmenorrhoea (OR 8.1 [95% CI: 7.2-9.3]), menorrhagia (OR 4.0 [95% CI: 3.5-4.5]), subfertility (OR 8.2 [95% CI: 6.9-9.9]), dyspareunia and/or postcoital bleeding (OR 6.8 [95% CI: 5.7-8.2]), and ovarian cysts (OR 7.3 [95% CI: 5.7-9.4]), and of being diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR 1.6 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) or pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 3.0 [95% CI: 2.5-3.6]). Endometriosis may coexist with or be misdiagnosed as pelvic inflammatory disease or IBS. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 3.1-3.9]). Even after women had been diagnosed with endometriosis, they were still two and a half times more likely to receive a new diagnosis of IBS when compared with the controls (OR 2.5 [95% CI: 2.2-2.8]). CONCLUSIONS: Women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with IBS and PID than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached. In women, clinical studies suggest that functional pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia, are co-morbid with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, and others diseases. In women, clinical studies suggest that pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis, which are associated with visceral hyperalgesia, are often comorbid with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.  Depression, anxiety, IBS, FM, CFS, and IC were more common in migraine with EM group than in controls. Intestinal endometriosis can mimic many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and neoplasms. Endometriosis is often associated with other painful conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia.  CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered in women with recurrent monthly abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, especially if accompanied by gynaecologic complaints, even because the significant symptoms overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and makes the differentiation extremely difficult. Intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.

The relatively high NT-proBNP levels after active recovery when psychophysical stress is higher, because of cycling and cold water immersion, suggest that not only endurance exercise, but also strenuous, stressful short exercise can induce an increase in NT-proBNP concentrations. Running a marathon significantly increases NT-pro-BNP levels in healthy adults. This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress. Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise. The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects. The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future. In healthy cyclists, transient increases in NT-pro-BNP and cTnT are more likely to reflect cardiac fatigue than injury. The rise in BNP in older athletes may reflect a reversible, mainly diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.  Plasma BNP concentrations were higher in both the judo and marathon groups than in controls, and positively correlated with LV mass as well as with deceleration time.

Some researchers have suggested that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma. We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases) Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Ewings sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs). The presence of this translocation in Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor has been taken as evidence that these two tumors are related. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Indistinguishable patterns of protooncogene expression in two distinct but closely related tumors: Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma. Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12). Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET) are a group of small round cell sarcomas that show varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation characterized by translocation involving the EWS gene Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs) Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) This genetical similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?", "context": "Amplification of MET has been reported in approximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Resistance to EGFR inhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment of resistant tumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. HGF mediated both ERK and Akt phosphorylation. ERK/Akt signaling, but not the Smad pathway, may be one of the main processes in HGF-induced EMT, The MAPK/Akt pathway is indispensable in HGF/c-Met signaling. Inhibition of c-Met activation sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met activity led to suppression of the PI3K-Akt pathway, thus enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity. Our study clearly suggests that inhibition of c-Met activity can effectively sensitize osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling. We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. Here, we report that i) treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; Our data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action, and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; Hepatocyte growth factor-induced c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibits dendritic cell activation by blocking IκB kinase activity Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation. Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling. Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha. HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland. Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met promote dendritic maturation during hippocampal neuron differentiation via the Akt pathway Consistent with these results, HGF activated Akt, which phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) to inactivate it, and reduced phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which can promote microtubule polymerization and dendrite elongation when dephosphorylated. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of c-Met with its specific inhibitor, PHA-665752, or genetic knock-down of c-Met with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, increased phosphorylation of MAP2, and reduced dendrite number and length in cultured hippocampal neurons. Inhibiting Akt activity with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor X suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, increased MAP2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability of HGF to enhance dendritic length. These observations indicate that HGF and c-Met can regulate the early stages of dendrite maturation via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. Involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of uveal melanoma cells HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells. HGF protects cultured cortical neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cell injury via ERK1/2 and PI-3K/Akt pathways HGF stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt activities in cortical neurons. Inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished the protective effects of HGF, and inhibition of Akt activation reduced, but did not completely eliminate the HGF mediated neuroprotection. It is suggested that the neuroprotection of HGF depend on ERK1/2 pathway, and, to a lesser extent, PI-3K/Akt pathway.  Met signals hepatocyte survival by preventing Fas-triggered FLIP degradation in a PI3k-Akt-dependent manner Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases. The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2.5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect. X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression level in colorectal cancer is regulated by hepatocyte growth factor/C-met pathway via Akt signaling Activation of XIAP expression by HGF was inhibited by siRNA targeting Akt1 and Akt2. Activation of C-MET enhances XIAP through the Akt pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor prevents ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in mice via Akt pathway and angiogenesis A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes but not of keratinocyte-derived cell lines via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect. We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?", "context": "H1N1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications This case series confirms a high number of complications in pregnant women due to pandemic H1N1/09. Pregnant women might be at increased risk for complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection. Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection.  Vaccination of pregnant women against influenza A (H1N1) by Russian subunit formulation (MonoGrippol plus) showed reactogenicity comparable to control group by the level of influence on general metabolic and immunologic homeostasis and on the course of pregnancy, which is an evidence of its safety Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. Although limited in size, the fully prospective nature of the safety follow-up of these women vaccinated during pregnancy is unique and offers an important degree of reassurance for the use of the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine in this high risk group for H1N1 infection. During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, pregnant women constituted one of the priority groups for vaccination in many countries, creating a need for close monitoring of the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women Emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) infection Pregnant women have been identified as a group at risk, both for respiratory complications than for the admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic This report mitigates substantially the presumed severity of pandemic H1N1/09 influenza infection during pregnancy The results of our study do not indicate a risk for the pregnant woman and the developing embryo/fetus after H1N1 vaccination This large cohort study found no evidence of an increased risk of fetal death associated with exposure to an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine during pregnancy Our results suggest that second- or third-trimester H1N1 vaccination was associated with improved fetal and neonatal outcomes during the recent pandemic Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly Pregnant women with H1N1 infection seem to benefit from antiviral therapy. arly identification and treatment were the most important factors in different countries and areas examined. The vaccine and antiviral drugs that have been the most efficient means to control the novel virus appear to be safe but require more extensive study However, there were significant differences between the two groups in relation to mean age, treatment with oseltamivir, schooling, and presence of other risk factors To investigate whether exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. In this Danish cohort, exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate regnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes In this large, geographically diverse population, A(H1N1)pdm09 infection increased the risk for hospitalization during pregnancy Vaccination during pregnancy with Pandemrix(®) appeared to have no ill effects on the pregnancy. On the contrary, the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight was lower than expected, which agrees with some previous results During the influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 pandemic, although many cases occurred in younger adults, the risk factors identified for severe infections and complications were similar to those for seasonal influenza, including chronic respiratory, renal, liver, and heart diseases. In terms of pregnancy, the studies have shown contradictory results due to variations in methodology and medical care. However, it seems that pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications, and that early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes. Pregnant women with mild clinical illness secondary to 2009 H1N1 were not at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes However, severely infected women were more likely to deliver SGA infants Gestational age is associated with the risk of developing critical infection. The risk increases with increasing weeks of gestation.  Following the start of winter in Liaoning province in China, the number of pregnant women infected with influenza increased significantly regnancy, with or without additional complications, constitutes a high-risk condition for complications of influenza infection and warrants early intervention with neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, if influenza is suspected", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Are transcribed ultraconserved regions involved in cancer?", "context": "Although most cancer research has focused in mRNA, non-coding RNAs are also an essential player in tumorigenesis. In addition to the well-recognized microRNAs, recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), also occur in human neoplasia Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells.

Most recent studies show that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas, leading to the hypothesis that UCRs may play a role in tumorigenesis and promising innovative future T-UCR-based therapeutic approaches CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis An integrative genomics screen uncovers ncRNA T-UCR functions in neuroblastoma tumours Different classes of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, have recently been implicated in the process of tumourigenesis.

Pendred syndrome (PDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness, goiter and iodide organification defect. Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre. Pendred syndrome, a common autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter, is caused by mutations of SLC26A4, which codes for pendrin. These studies provide compelling evidence that defects in pendrin cause Pendred syndrome thereby launching a new area of investigation into thyroid physiology, the pathogenesis of congenital deafness and the role of altered sulphate transport in human disease. Mutations in the Pendred syndrome gene have been observed in patients with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation, in the absence of other Pendred syndrome features.

Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been subclassified as five defined entities which represent clinical circumstances in which both the heart and the kidney are involved in a bidirectional injury and dysfunction via a final common pathway of cell-to-cell death and accelerated apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress. There is a strong association between both acute and chronic dysfunction of the heart and kidneys with respect to morbidity and mortality. Both blood and urine biomarkers, including the assessment of catalytic iron, a critical element to the generation of oxygen-free radicals and oxidative stress, are reviewed in this paper. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention.

PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models.  Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range: 21-63.8 months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (range: 6.8-51.2 months). OS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs. Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.  Our meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of using VPA (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.71). Sub-group analysis shows that patients treated with VPA had a hazard ratio of 0.74 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.59-0.94 vs. patients treated by other-AEDs and a hazard ratio of 0.66 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.52-0.84 vs. patients treated by administration of non-AEDs.  .CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.  A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.  Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT) Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS.RESULTS: Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA.  When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Patients using VPA in combination with temozolomide showed a longer median survival of 69 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7-67.3) compared with 61 weeks (95% CI: 52.5-69.5) in the group without VPA (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; P = .016), adjusting for age, extent of resection, and O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation status. Use of VPA together with chemoradiation with temozolomide results in a 2-months' longer survival of patients with GBM.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?", "context": "By contrast, fatigue worsened over time, with a difference in mean score of 5.6 points between baseline and 4-month follow-up (P=.02). In the GB cohort, the most common side effects were fatigue (56 %), diarrhea (44 %), neutropenia (31 %), and thrombocytopenia (25 %).  A total of 37 patients were treated, and treatment was well tolerated: grade 3, 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 30% of patients and consisted mainly of fatigue (14%) and neuropathy (5%); grade 3, 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 37% of patients and consisted of thrombocytopenia (30%), lymphopenia (4%), and neutropenia (4%).  Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient. The most common grade 3 events were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and infection in 25, 20, 13, and 10%, respectively.  Analysis of the results of the VAS Norris scale did not demonstrate an increase in emotional fatigue but did show an increase in physical fatigue that did not reach statistical significance. With regards to the MFI 20 tool, analysis of the results demonstrated a significant increase in general (P=0.0260) as well as physical (P=0.0141) fatigue but there was no difference in the other indices. This study demonstrated a progressive increase in physical fatigue in patients with glioblastoma relapse treated with irinotecan-bevacizumab.  One patient treated with temozolomide plus isotretinoin plus thalidomide had dose-limiting grade 3 fatigue and rash, and 1 patient receiving all 4 agents had dose-limiting grade 4 neutropenia.  The toxicities observed were primarily grade 1 and 2, and the most common were fatigue, hypertension, and headache.  Fatigue (41%), rash (62%), and loose stools (58%) constituted the most frequent adverse events, the majority of these being limited to Grade 1/2.  The most common grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting (6.7%) and fatigue (5.8%).  Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), ALT elevation (n = 3), AST elevation (n = 1), CNS hemorrhage (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and thrombotic/embolic events (n = 3); 8 patients required dose reduction.  The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were fatigue (7%), neutropaenia (7%), and thrombocytopaenia (7%). Bevacizumab-related toxicity included fatigue (16 patients; 4 grade 3), leukopenia (9; 1 grade 3), anemia (5; 0 grade 3), hypertension (7; 1 grade 3), deep vein thrombosis (4; 1 grade 3) and wound dehiscence (2; 1 grade 3).  Tiredness may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Some patients describe a sense of tiredness particularly after radiation or oral chemotherapy. Levels of tiredness in patients with GBM were greatly affected by the radiotherapy and oral chemotherapy (temozolomide). The treatment had no negative effect on HRQOL, however, fatigue (P = 0.02) and constipation (P = 0.01) scales worsened over time.  This regimen was well tolerated with grade 3/4 toxicities of fatigue, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and rash requiring dose reductions.  The most common atrasentan-related toxicities were grade 1 or 2 rhinitis, fatigue, and edema. One patient developed Grade IV fatigue at the 100 ng/mL dose, but the MTD has not been established.  Side-effects in all patients have included varying degrees of anorexia, fatigue, ipsilateral forehead dermatitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis.   Some patients suffered from fatigue and weak concentration about three months after the end of radiotherapy, in some cases even the neurologic state was deteriorated.  grade 1-2 common toxicities included fever, chills, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headache, neutrophilia and skin painful reactions appeared regularly at levels 3 and 4 (2.5 mg and 3.5 mg).  Ten episodes of grade 3/4 adverse events were observed in nine patients, including fatigue (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 4), and myelotoxicity, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism (each n = 1). Common adverse events were CTCAE grade 1-2 fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and nausea.

{"question": "Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?", "context": "To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts haracterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomes Our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci In brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent action Here, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements Chromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions ∼5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR) TCF physically links cohesin to chromatin ohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation? Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo Recent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF Here we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genes These results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function Increased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locus icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locus ecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex We show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF Taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function The only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ring These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability. TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin. enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulation Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within ∼1-2 kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control. These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?", "context": "SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS. Recent work connecting TDP-43 and FUS to stress granules has suggested how this cellular pathway, which involves protein aggregation as part of its normal function, might be coopted during disease pathogenesis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) belongs to the group of RNA-binding proteins implicated as underlying factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). Profilin 1 associates with stress granules and ALS-linked mutations alter stress granule dynamics Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. RNA-binding ability of FUS regulates neurodegeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules associated with FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia, where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress.  We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked FUS/TLS alters stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.  . Autophagy regulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked fused in sarcoma-positive stress granules in neurons However, the role of autophagy in regulation of FUS-positive stress granules (SGs) and aggregates remains unclear.  Although co-localized primarily in the nucleus in normal condition, FUS/TLS and PRMT1 were partially recruited to the cytoplasmic granules under oxidative stress, which were merged with stress granules (SGs) markers in SH-SY5Y cell. The effect of PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of FUS/TLS Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration. Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs).

{"question": "Does TGF-beta play a role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?", "context": "We then performed a chemical screen and identified several small molecules that increase or reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development. These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor β signaling pathways.  Here, we report that the balance between the reparative and regenerative processes is achieved through Smad3-dependent TGFβ signaling.  Thus, TGFβ signaling orchestrates the beneficial interplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to achieve complete heart regeneration. As expected, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a profibrotic cytokine, was dramatically upregulated in MI hearts, but its phosphorylated comediator (pSmad) was significantly downregulated in the nuclei of Cx43-deficient hearts post-MI, suggesting that downstream signaling of TGF-beta is diminished substantially in Cx43-deficient hearts. This diminution in profibrotic TGF-beta signaling resulted in the attenuation of adverse structural remodeling as assessed by echocardiography. Potentially beneficial changes include increases in the HSMP secretory-leucocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1). Targeting these proteins may mitigate enhanced LV remodeling and dysfunction with aging. After injury, the presence of macrophages, which secreted high levels of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, led to rapid removal of cell debris and replacement by granulation tissue containing inflammatory cells and blood vessels, followed by myofibroblast infiltration and collagen deposition. Secretion of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A as well as neovascularization, myofibroblast infiltration, and collagen deposition decreased.  Repression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis, mediated in part through Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta and Interleukin (IL)-10, is critical for resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and transition to fibrous tissue deposition. TGF-beta conducted the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression. Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration.

Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R. DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects.   Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply.

{"question": "Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?", "context": "We here provide a systematic overview of the therapeutic effects of amantadine, apomorphine and zolpidem in patients recovering from coma. Evidence from clinical trials using these commonly prescribed pharmacological agents suggests positive changes in the neurological status in patients, leading sometimes to dramatic improvements. Pharmaceuticals that act in the oxygen based amino acid systems of the brain include the GABAergic medications zolpidem and baclofen, while those that act in the monoamine axes include the dopaminergic medications L Dopa, amantadine, bromocriptine, apomorphine and methylphenidate, and the noradrenergic and serotonergic medications desipramine, amitriptyline, protriptyline and fluoxetine.  Sporadic cases of recovery from a DOC have been reported after the administration of various pharmacological agents (baclofen, zolpidem, amantadine etc.). Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Preliminary studies have suggested that amantadine may promote functional recovery.  During the 4-week treatment period, recovery was significantly faster in the amantadine group than in the placebo group, as measured by the DRS score (difference in slope, 0.24 points per week; P=0.007), indicating a benefit with respect to the primary outcome measure.  Amantadine accelerated the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness. Sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from DOC after the administration of various pharmacological agents, such as baclofen, zolpidem and amantadine, have been recently supported by intriguing scientific observations.  According to the 16 eligible studies, medical management by dopaminergic agents (levodopa, amantadine), zolpidem and median nerve stimulation, or surgical management by deep brain stimulation, extradural cortical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal baclofen have shown to improve the level of consciousness in certain cases.  Higher exposure of amantadine (average concentration of amantadine during 6 mg/kg/day > 1.5 mg/L) may be associated with better recovery of consciousness.  Based on the preliminary data, higher dosing may be considered in the setting of brain injury. Patients treated with PK-Merz exhibited the more significant restoration of consciousness and better dynamics (regress) of neurological deficit with the most intensive restoration of neurological deficit in the first day that allows to recommend the use of amantadine sulfate in the first hours of ischemic stroke and for the prevention of reperfusion damage in recanalisation therapy of ischemic stroke. There was no significant difference in the slopes of recovery during either arm for the Coma/Near-Coma Scale (P = 0.24) or the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (P = 0.28), although improvements in consciousness were noted by the physician during weeks when amantadine was given (P = 0.02).  This study suggests that amantadine facilitates recovery of consciousness in pediatric acquired brain injury and provides important information necessary to design future more definitive studies. The study has shown a positive effect of this drug at coma emergence, which manifested itself as clinical improvement and a better outcome of the disease. This article will review the evidence for the use of psychostimulants (methylphenidate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buproprion), Parkinson's medications (amantadine, bromocriptine, carbidopa/levodopa), anticonvulsants (valproic acid), modafinil (Provigil), lactate, hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electroconvulsive therapy, and transmagnetic stimulation, in patients following a head injury.

Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.

Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile.  Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, introduced in 1960's as an anti-anginal agent, emerged as a potent anti-arrhythmic agent by 1970's and is currently one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in US for ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent. Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties.

{"question": "Does strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?", "context": "The results of the present study in a unique experimental human model of maximal exposure to altitude and physical exercise demonstrate that extreme HA and strenuous physical exercise are coupled with specific endocrine adaptations. These include increased activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and a low T(3) syndrome 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels increase during strenuous exercise, and, at the end of the exercise bout, a decrease of T3 and T4 levels, with an increase in TSH during the following 4-5 days, is seen. the obtained results indicate that in intense exercise, causing the rapid development of fatigue, rapid increases in serum levels of hormones of the pituitary-adrenocortical, pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-thyroid systems occur. Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight. Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training. brief strenuous swimming or moderate bicycle exercise had minor or no effect on thyroid hormone concentrations when consideration was given to the attendant hemoconcentration. thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period.

In recent years, the role of epigenetic phenomenon, such as methylation, in mediating vulnerability to behavioral illness has become increasingly appreciated. One prominent locus at which epigenetic phenomena are thought to be in play is the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) locus.  We conclude that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order.

{"question": "Is there any software for automated analysis of FISH images?", "context": "he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images. A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, …,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods. hybridization (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to more accurately and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, a huge amount of image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3-D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence image scanning system was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2-D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0.69 to 1.0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples.  In this paper we developed a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm minimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive M-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in classification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared. Results from our statistical analysis have shown that Homotopy based method is significantly better than the other two methods.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes. The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas.

{"question": "Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?", "context": "The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Taken together, we found a novel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGFβRIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by myocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling. It is still controversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of cardiac fibrosis. In mice, myocardial miR-21 overexpression is related to cardiac fibrosis elicited by pressure overload.  The myocardial and plasma levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in the AS patients compared with the controls and correlated directly with the echocardiographic mean transvalvular gradients. Our results support the role of miR-21 as a regulator of the fibrotic process that occurs in response to pressure overload in AS patients and underscore the value of circulating miR-21 as a biomarker for myocardial fibrosis. Ad-miR-21 improves LV remodeling and decreases the apoptosis of myocardial cells, suggesting the possible mechanism by which Ad-miR-21 functions in protecting against I/R injury. In the Ad-miR-21 group, LV dimensions, myocardial infarct size, LV/BW, collagen type Ⅰ, type Ⅲ and PCNA positive cells all significantly decreased compared with the Ad-GFP group. While miR-21, -133, -150, -195, and -214 regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-1/-133 and miR-208 have been elucidated to influence myocardial contractile function.

The small regulatory RNA microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a crucial role in a plethora of biological functions and diseases including development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. During recent years, additional roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, including cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis as well as myocardial infarction have been described. On the other hand, miR-21, miR-199a, miR-210, and miR-494 have been proven critical for the myocytes' adaptation and survival during hypoxia/ischemia.  Studies have shown that several miRs, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-126, miR-320, miR-92a, and miR-199a, are regulated after preconditioning and play an active role in protecting the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed that its expression is deregulated in heart and vasculature under cardiovascular disease conditions such as proliferative vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. miR-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions. Accordingly, miR-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. This review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular disease. Remarkably, miR-21 was one of most upregulated miRNAs in hearts after IP. In vivo, IP-mediated cardiac protection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury was inhibited by knockdown of cardiac miR-21. In cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 also had a protective effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene, programmed cell death 4. The protective effect of miR-21 on cardiac cell apoptosis was further confirmed in rat hearts after ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas. The down-regulation of miR-21 in the infarcted areas was inhibited by ischemic preconditioning, a known cardiac protective method. Overexpression of miR-21 via adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by 29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4 and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21. The results suggest that miRNAs such as miR-21 may play critical roles in the early phase of AMI. The results suggest that miR-21 is sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts Myocardial and circulating levels of microRNA-21 reflect left ventricular fibrosis in aortic stenosis patients MicroRNA 21 inhibits left ventricular remodeling in the early phase of rat model with ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing cell apoptosis MicroRNA-21 protects against the H(2)O(2)-induced injury on cardiac myocytes via its target gene PDCD4 MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases MicroRNA-21 as therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular disease. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts.

We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm that histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor and an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the literature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES cells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state.

{"question": "Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?", "context": "Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs. he new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications;  Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication. But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote.  While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in \"real-life\" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Rivaroxaban, which inhibits activated factor X (Xa), is currently in clinical trials and is the most advanced factor Xa inhibitor. The drug offers once-daily oral dosing, with no need for injections, dose titration, or frequent blood tests to monitor the international normalised ratio. It has a rapid onset of action and, although there is no specific antidote, it has a short plasma elimination half-life (about 5-9 hours).  Increased use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban as oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and acute deep venous thrombosis has increased despite the lack of known antidotes to these medications. There is no antidote for reversal and no reliable laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect for emergency situations.  Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. Specific antidotes for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies against the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or recombinant Xa-analog in the case of factor Xa inhibitors, are still being investigated in early clinical trials. In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for severe bleeding linked to these drugs.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

{"question": "Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?", "context": "Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers. Previously we had shown the synergic effect of bortezomib and thiostrepton in breast cancer cells in vitro, where sub-apoptotic concentrations of both proteasome inhibitors resulted in synergic increase in cell death when combined as a treatment. Here, we administered such a combination to MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo, and found that the effect of complementary proteasome inhibitors reduced tumor growth rates more efficiently than compared with when administered alone. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor to anti-hormonal therapy resulted in a clinical benefit rate of 22% in a limited number of patients with endocrine resistant and progressive metastatic breast cancer. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of MLN9708 for both hematologic and solid tumor indications. Bortezomib has minimal activity as a single-agent in the treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC/PPC Our study indicates a molecular mechanism by which the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells is regulated by the level of GRP78 as well as preferential induction of GRP78 or CHOP upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Our experiments therefore suggest a novel approach toward sensitization of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.0 mg (equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week. This dose correlates with 70% inhibition of 20S proteasome activity. The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in this schedule is 1.6 mg/m(2). Biologic activity (inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B-related markers) and antitumor activity is seen in AIPCa at tolerated doses of bortezomib. Given the results of this trial, it is safe and reasonable to recommend treatment with PS341 on the schedule used in this trial at 1.56 mg/m2/dose in Phase II trials.

The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis We also show that, in contrast to mitosis, RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Cft8), Ctf4 and Chl1 are essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and for the viability of meiotic products. Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ctf8 deletion strain as a primary screen to identify other nonessential genes required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion. We then assessed proficiency of cohesion at three chromosomal loci in strains containing deletions of the genes identified in the ctf8 SGA screen. Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion CTF4 and CTF18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion.

Heterozygous 2- to 3-week- old mice exhibit a severe retardation of post-natal development and growth, but only a minor reduction in serum thyroxine levels.  The data demonstrate a novel array of effects mediated by a dominant negative TRalpha1, and may provide important clues for identification of a potentially unrecognized human disorder and its treatment. No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice.

Treatment with GIK, T3, and GIK/T3 improves hemodynamic performance and results in reduced cTnI release in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for postoperative pacemaker support was reduced. Perioperative T3 administration decreased the incidence and need for treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Intravenous T(3) does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has been previously suggested.  Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. No significant differences were noted in the pre and post CPB hemodynamics between the two groups for the most part of the study except that heart rate was increased in T3 group.

{"question": "Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?", "context": "A diversity of cardiovascular disorders including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary anomalies, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic rupture due to Marfan syndrome, myocarditis, valvular disease and electrical disorders (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), as well as commotio cordis represent the common causes of SCD in young athletes. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum. The majority of cases are caused by an underlying structural cardiac abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed.  This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.  Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all physicians and allied health professionals.  In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and commotio cordis.  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited cardiac disorders. The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other reasons are congenital coronary artery anomalies, nivocarditis, dilatative cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle, sarcoidosis, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve stenosis, atherosclerosis, long QT syndrome, and blunt impact to the chest. The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.  A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi.  This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins.  Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8].  Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases.

{"question": "Has vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?", "context": "However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke. Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling .Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly. We found 26 eligible trials of moderate quality that enrolled 45,782 participants, the majority of which were elderly and female. Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96) This effect was more prominent in patients who were vitamin D deficient at baseline and in studies in which calcium was coadministered with vitamin D. Vitamin D combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls. The majority of the evidence is derived from trials enrolling elderly women. Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms.  There is evidence to suggest that these agents may reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and falls; however, their benefit on vertebral fracture reduction may depend on the type of active vitamin D.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation. miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin.

{"question": "Is it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?", "context": "Isotretinoin is a remarkably effective drug for severe, recalcitrant acne vulgaris. a number of important adverse effects were reported even the most recent pregnancy prevention program (iPledge) is no more successful than prior programs; there will likely always be a small number of female patients becoming pregnant while receiving isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. Isotretinoin has revolutionized the management of acne vulgaris. The adverse effect(s) that led to patients stopping isotretinoin were cheilitis (22 patients), mood change (13), tiredness (12), eczema (6) and pregnancy (2). Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling by isotretinoin explains its therapeutic effect in acne. Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling during the first trimester of pregnancy disturbs branched morphogenesis and explains retinoid embryotoxicity. The isotretinoin, a 13-cis-retinoic acid, has revolutionized the management of severe treatment-resistant acne and it has been widely used for a range of dermatological conditions, in 90% of the time in young women between 13 and 45 years of age. This agent has severe teratogenic effects, as serious craniofacial, cardiovascular, thymic and central nervous system malformations. malformations is 3-5%, but it increases to almost 30% in women exposed to isotretinoin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Generally, patients in treatment with isotretinoin avoid eventual pregnancy during assumption and, after its stopping, fertility and foetal development are normal once circulating isotretinoin levels return to normal. After 3 months of pharmacological wash out, patient become pregnant and manifested this severe malformation. Woman interrupted gestation, by labour induction. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% together with tretinoin 0.025% as a gel (CTG) is a topical formulation of a fixed and stable combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. Safety of CTG use in pregnancy has not been established. To estimate the population-based incidence rates of pregnancy, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects associated with isotretinoin use, and to determine predictors of pregnancy while on isotretinoin Pregnancies, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects were identified using procedure codes and medical diagnoses. 90 women who became pregnant while on the drug, 76 terminated the pregnancy (84%), three had a spontaneous abortion (3%), two had trauma during delivery resulting in neonatal deaths (2%) and nine had a live birth (10%). Among the live births, only one had a congenital anomaly of the face and neck (11%). elective abortion rates were also much higher in our study. Topical antibiotics, isotretinoin or systemic antibiotics are usually used for acne therapy. However, isotretinoin cannot be used during pregnancy because it can cause significant birth defects while systemic antibiotics can have adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity and tetracycline sensitivity. Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne since 1982. Its current indications in the package insert are limited and many physicians still feel uncomfortable prescribing it because of its side effects. Aside from its teratogenic effect, isotretinoin is a safe and excellent drug for acne therapy. I a pregnancy test in females. Vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid, tretinoin and isotretinoin, are currently used in dermatological treatments. The administration of high doses of this vitamin provokes congenital malformations in mice: cleft palate, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia and total or partial fusion of the maxillary incisors. Twelve 60-day-old female Mus musculus were divided into two groups on the 7th day of pregnancy: treated group--1 mg isotretinoin per kg body weight, dissolved in vegetable oil, was administered from the 7th to the 13th day of pregnancy; control group--vegetable oil in equivalent volume was administered orally for the same period. On the 16th day of pregnancy, the females were sacrificed, the fetuses were removed and their heads amputated. The results showed that both groups had closed palates with no reminiscence of epithelial cells; however, the first molar germs of the isotretinoin-treated animals showed delayed development compared to the control animals. Isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) is teratogenic in all species examined; based on administered dose, humans appear most sensitive, followed by (in order or decreasing sensitivity) monkey, rabbit, hamster, mouse, and rat. Based on embryonic delivered dose, we suggest that 13-cis-RA is an equipotent teratogen in hamster and rabbit. its safety in humans is occasionally questioned because oral ingestion of retinoids at therapeutic levels is known to entail teratogenic risks. topical tretinoin is not a potential human developmental toxicant. Teratogenicity of vitamin A was firstly detected in experimental animals in 1953. Nearly 30 years later, teratogenicity of vitamin A analogue-isotretinoin was reported in humans. Isotretinoin induces serious birth defects of craniofacial and central nervous system, cardiovascular system and thymic malformations--in about 25% of babies exposed during the first trimester of their prenatal development. high vitamin A intake in pregnant woman: Women who use daily vitamin A supplements during early pregnancy have approximately a two-fold increased risk of giving birth to a malformed baby. Vitamin A started to affect development between doses 0.3-0.3 microm [corrected] per embryo. Malformations of head, extremities and heart were detected similarly like in laboratory mammals and in man the minimal embryotoxic doses of vitamin A in mammals were estimated to be between 0.1-1 mg/kg of maternal weight Human epidemiological studies have proved teratogenicity of vitamin A after daily doses 25,000 i.u.-8.3 mg (0.13 mg/kg)- and reduction of its maximum intake has been recommended to 10,000 i.u. per day (0.05 mg/kg). The results about teratogenicity of vitamin A achieved in the chick embryo are in agreement with such a recommendation. Intake of vitamin A in the food is sufficient for pregnant woman in common Czech population. Therefore, an artificial supplementation of vitamin A brings risk of overdosage. If supplementation by vitamin A is unavoidable during pregnancy, B-carotene should be preferred. a teratogenic dosing regimen with 13-cis-RA [Hummler et al. (1994) Teratology 50:184-193]. plasma AUC values of all-trans-RA were 2- to 7-fold higher after all-trans-RA administration (present study) than after dosing with the teratogenic dose of 13-cis-RA. These results strengthen our recent suggestion that the teratogenic effects induced in cynomolgus monkeys by 13-cis-RA treatment cannot solely result from the action of all-trans-RA, but may involve 13-cis-RA and 13-cis-4-oxo-RA, which could act directly or function as transport vehicle. VITA, among others, is involved in the process of morphogenesis. In contrast, synthetic derivatives of VITA, specifically Tigasone (etretinate, TIG) and Roaccutane (isotretinoin, ROA), are regarded as major teratogens. A biphasic maximal inhibition was present at 1 microM concentrations when the retinoids VITA, TIG and ROA were added for 16 h (52, 58 and 57%, respectively; P < 0.01 by one-way analysis of variance). In contrast, the addition of the three retinoids at 1 microM concentrations for 16 h had no significant effect on HCG secretion by placental explants of 11-13 weeks gestational age. Inhibition of HCG secretion by retinoids may contribute either directly or indirectly to their teratogenicity. Isotretinoin is a potent retinoic acid used in the treatment of skin disorders. Though very effective, it is teratogenic if administered during pregnancy, and its teratogenic effect may be related to the normal activity of retinoids as signalling molecules in the embryo. defects that includes heart defects, by inhibiting the migration of neural crest cells. Proliferation in heart tissue of whole embryo cultures was inhibited in medium with 10(-6) M isotretinoin to 62% of the control level in myocardium. The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis. Oral administration of 400 mg/kg of 13-cis retinoic acid to 9 day pregnant mice gives rise to important maxillofacial malformations. The first manifestation of teratogenic effect is an increase of density of cell death arising in the dorsal part of the first two branchial arches at day 9.5. These two arches become hypoplastic at days 10 and 11, and the preskeletal anlagen appear too late in comparison to control embryos. Meckel's cartilage is too curvilinear and medially situated. Pre-ossicular and pre-mandibular blastemata develop with spatial distortions which are well analyzable at days 16 and 17 Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane) increases the risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. However, there have been no epidemiologic reports to date on the effect of a subsequent pregnancy after discontinuation of isotretinoin. analysis of pregnancy case reports from patients in whom conception occurred after isotretinoin treatment had been discontinued spontaneous and missed abortions from all pregnancies was 9.1% (eight patients), and the incidence rate of congenital malformation among the live births was 5.0% (four patients). were not significantly different from the rates reported for women of reproductive age in the general population. In addition, the malformations reported were not characteristic of retinoic acid-induced congenital anomalies. Keratolenticular dysgenesis (Peters' anomaly) was induced in mice by exposure to the human teratogens, ethanol or 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin, Accutane). Acute teratogen exposure on the seventh day of gestation (corresponding to the third week of human gestation) resulted in an eye malformation incidence of 46% to 100% in day 14 fetuses This secondary effect on neural crest derivatives is exhibited in the adult animals as corneal opacities associated with defects in Descemet's membrane and endothelium, and anterior polar cataracts. 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, or isotretinoin) is responsible for various craniofacial malformations in the rodent and human embryo. In whole embryo culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. subsequent cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial malformations. Reports of adverse human pregnancy outcomes including cleft palate have increased as the clinical use of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) and other retinoic acid (RA) derivatives have increased, but the mechanisms by which their effects are exerted are not understood. In shelves exposed to EGF and trans-RA early in their development, DNA synthesis appears to terminate prematurely as compared to shelves cultured in control media, and this effect is accompanied by excessive mesenchymal extracellular space expansion. Exposure of shelves to EGF alone is sufficient to block degeneration and induce hyperplasia of the medial epithelial cells but does not induce other ultrastructural changes seen with both EGF and RA. The observed alterations in medial cell morphology could interfere with adhesion of the palatal shelves and may play a role in retinoid-induced cleft palate in the human embryo. Recent clinical observations strongly suggest that isotretinoin [13-cis-retinoic acid (cis RA)] is a human teratogen causing primarily heart and craniofacial malformations including ear and palatal defects. Our results demonstrate that labeled cis RA enters the tissues of the embryo both in vivo and in vitro. Cis RA inhibited proliferation of the frontonasal mesenchyme cells in primary culture with 31% inhibition occurring at 2 X 10(-5) M cis RA. Retinoic acid, an analogue of vitamin A, is known to be teratogenic in laboratory animals and has recently been implicated in a few clinical case reports. To study the human teratogenicity of this agent, we investigated 154 human pregnancies with fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a retinoid prescribed for severe recalcitrant cystic acne. The outcomes were 95 elective abortions, 26 infants without major malformations, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 21 malformed infants. A subset of 36 of the 154 pregnancies was observed prospectively. Exposure to isotretinoin was associated with an unusually high relative risk for a group of selected major malformations (relative risk = 25.6; 95 per cent confidence interval, 11.4 to 57.5). It is possible that a major mechanism of isotretinoin teratogenesis is a deleterious effect on cephalic neural-crest cell activity that results in the observed craniofacial, cardiac, and thymic malformations.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}
{"question": "Can DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?", "context": "The aporphine alkaloids (+)-dicentrine and (+)-bulbocapnine are non-planar molecules lacking features normally associated with DNA binding by intercalation or minor groove binding. Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent. Quinacrine was less effective. (ii) Inhibitors intercalating and binding to the 'cleavable' DNA-topoisomerase complex (m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) strongly suppressed reparative DNA incision.  DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.  Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation. Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].  All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA. Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.  AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator. Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.  We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA. At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure. Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed. The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs. These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA. Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. Structure-activity relationship of polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as DNA intercalators, DNA photocleavage reagents, and DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. In addition, fragments of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin.  The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.  Long-term inhibition of DNA synthesis and the persistence of trapped topoisomerase II complexes in determining the toxicity of the antitumor DNA intercalators mAMSA and mitoxantrone. Effects of the DNA intercalators 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium on topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand cleavage and strand passage. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.  Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy.  It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.  The gadd153 promoter was strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase inhibitors.  Our study indicates that Epoxy anthraquinone derivative may be a novel DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that can be potentially used for treatment of neuroblastoma or other cancer patients. Organic intercalators can inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, and they are now common anticancer drugs in clinical therapy.  Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops. To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action. In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects. Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ and to intercalate DNA. Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Increased rT3 may be more common in ESRD patients than previously described, and together with decreased T3 it may serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in subsequent months. The presence of TFT alterations seems to not be associated with clinical and prognostic implications in AKI patients. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, showed that mortality was best predicted by total triiodothyronine (T3). Finally, low T3 but not low free triiodothyronine was associated with worse all-cause (Likelihood ratio = 45.4; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (Likelihood ratio = 47.8; P < 0.0001) after adjustment for confounding factors.  In Cox analyses, fT3 was a significant predictor of mortality independent of the main traditional as well as non-traditional risk factors. All-cause and CV mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with 'lower' T3 levels than in the 'higher' T3 group (113.4 vs 18.2 events per 1000 patient-years, P<0.001, and 49.8 vs 9.1 events per 1000 patient-years, P=0.001, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed significantly worse cumulative survival rates in the 'lower' T3 group (P<0.001). In the Cox regression analysis, low T3 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality even after adjusting for traditional risk factors (hazard ratio=3.76, P=0.021).  In CKD patients with proteinuria, low T3 concentration predicted all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event independently of the severity of proteinuria. Low-T3 syndrome is a frequent finding among HD patients, but it does not predict outcome. However, serum fT3 level is a strong and inverse mortality predictor, in part explained by its underlying association with nutritional state and inflammation. These data suggest that low FT3 levels are not predictive for mortality in a subgroup of stable HD patients who could survive more than 12 months. Low fT3 is an independent predictor of death in hemodialysis patients.

{"question": "Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?", "context": "Forkhead-box class O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate mechanisms of cellular aging, including protein quality control, autophagy and defenses against oxidative stress. Statin-mediated upregulation of klotho expression and differential regulation of FoxO expression promote resistance to CsA-induced oxidative stress. FoxO expression suppressed the ROS-induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Differential expression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a confers resistance to oxidative cell death upon endometrial decidualization. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling. This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase. Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells. These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death.

Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria. In plasma, most metabolites in the central metabolic pathway (glycolysis and TCA cycle) were significantly downregulated after zymosan administration Thus, IL-1beta+TNFalpha treated astrocytes show a marked decrease in glycogen levels, a slight but not significant decrease in lactate release as well as a massive increase in both the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle activities. A total of 77 and 92 metabolites were detected in serum and colon tissue, respectively, and among the metabolites the compositions of TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids changed depending on the degree of colitis Extension of these findings identified a functional role for stretch-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in mediating normoxic HIF1A stabilization, concomitant increases in glycolytic capacity, and improved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function These studies reveal a surprising role for HIF1A in lung protection during ALI, where normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF-dependent control of alveolar-epithelial glucose metabolism function as an endogenous feedback loop to dampen lung inflammation These results suggest a cataplerosis of the TCA cycle induced by phenobarbital, caused by the massive withdrawal of succinyl-CoA by ALAS induction, such that the TCA cycle is unable to supply the reduced cofactors to the RC The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were explored in the Hmbs(-/-) mouse model. RC and TCA cycle were significantly affected in comparison to controls in mice treated with phenobarbital with decreased activities of RC complexes Several changes in substrate utilization for energy homeostasis were identified in severe AAH, including increased glucose consumption by the pentose phosphate pathway, altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and enhanced peptide catabolism.  Enhanced mitochondrial glucose oxidation was achieved by increased recruitment of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) to nuclear and mitochondrial genes that encode respiratory chain components and by NOTCH-dependent induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (Pdp1) expression, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and glucose flux to the TCA cycle.

{"question": "Are reduced-nicotine cigarettes effective for smoking cessation?", "context": "CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week study, reduced-nicotine cigarettes versus standard-nicotine cigarettes reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of cigarettes smoked.  RESULTS: Significant reductions in nicotine intake were observed between usual brand smoking (∼1.2 mg nicotine) and the 0.3 and 0.05 mg nicotine emission cigarettes, but not the 0.6 mg cigarette. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants. BACKGROUND: When switching from usual brand cigarettes, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, toxicant exposure, withdrawal symptoms and dependence.  Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. Results showed that Quest plus NRT was more effective than active control plus NRT in achieving 4 weeks of continuous abstinence (32.8% vs. 21.9%). Quest plus NRT offers promise as a new smoking cessation treatment. We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced-nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: The 0.05 mg nicotine yield cigarettes may be a tobacco product that can facilitate cessation; however, future research is clearly needed to support these preliminary findings. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment. Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation. Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates. The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking. Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment Specifically, standards that required substantially reduced nicotine content in cigarettes could enable cessation in smokers and prevent future smoking among current non-smokers Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking These results suggest that use of NRT before a target quit-smoking date deserves further evaluation as a possible smoking cessation treatment. Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake.

While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1. The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The major gene for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase RET. In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and their parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold susceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European ancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within the intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neurons in distal segments of the gut, shows a complex pattern of inheritance, with the RET protooncogene acting as a major gene and additional susceptibility loci playing minor roles. BACKGROUND: The RET gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in different human neurocristopathies, such as specific neuroendocrine tumours and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). The first major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease is the RET proto-oncogene on 10q11.2. The developmental abnormalities apparent in these mice, together with the observation that the major tissues affected in MEN 2 and Hirschsprung disease have a common origin in the embryonal neural crest, suggest that RET encodes a receptor for a developmental regulator involved in the genesis of a variety of neural crest derivatives, and in the organogenesis of the kidney. RET is the major gene involved in HSCR. Recent advances show that the RET gene is a major locus involved in the pathogenesis of HSCR. Although with several genes involved in its pathogenesis, the major HSCR gene is the RET proto-oncogene. In this model, a major gene, RET, is involved in most if not all cases of isolated (i.e., nonsyndromic) HSCR, in conjunction with other autosomal susceptibility loci under a multiplicative model. The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung (HSCR), a complex genetic disease characterized by lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the complex genetics of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or aganglionic megacolon, showing causative loss-of-function mutations in 15-30% of the sporadic cases The RET proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease Analysis of the RET gene, the major gene involved in HSCR susceptibility, revealed neither linkage nor mutations RET is the major gene involved in HSCR Although with several genes involved in its pathogenesis, the major HSCR gene is the RET proto-oncogene While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1 The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease Recent advances show that the RET gene is a major locus involved in the pathogenesis of HSCR In this model, a major gene, RET, is involved in most if not all cases of isolated (i.e., nonsyndromic) HSCR, in conjunction with other autosomal susceptibility loci under a multiplicative model We report on mutation analysis of five genes involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) or the endothelin-signalling pathways in 28 sporadic Japanese patients with Hirschsprung disease In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease The RET gene is the major HSCR gene, although reduced penetrance of RET mutations and variable expression of HSCR phenotype indicates that more than one gene is required", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?", "context": "We found a very significant increase in average longevity (17%) of the cyclists when compared with the general population. The age at which 50% of the general population died was 73.5 vs. 81.5 years in Tour de France participants. Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy. Medallists lived an average of 2.8 years longer than controls. Medallists in eight of the nine country groups had a significant survival advantage compared with controls. Gold, silver, and bronze medallists each enjoyed similar sized survival advantages. Medallists in endurance sports and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17; 1.11, 1.09 to 1.13) than that of medallists in power sports (1.05, 1.01 to 1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, irrespective of country, medal, or sport. This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory. Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality. Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females.

Mutations of EZH2, RUNX1, TP53, and ASXL1 were associated with shorter overall survival independent of the LR-PSS. In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2). Subsequently, analysis of deletion profiles of other PRC2 members revealed frequent losses of genes such as EZH2, AEBP2, and SUZ12; however, the deletions targeting these genes were large. We also identified two patients with homozygous losses of JARID2 and AEBP2. We observed frequent codeletion of AEBP2 and ETV6, and similarly, SUZ12 and NF1. A total of 25 different EZH2 mutations were detected in 5.9% of PMF, 1.2% of PPV-MF, and 9.4% of PET-MF patients; most were exonic heterozygous missense changes. In the present investigation we have focused on the candidate region in 6p23, a region that have been found linked to CL/P in several investigations, in the attempt to find out the susceptibility gene provisionally named OFC1.

Among the MI-regulated miRNAs are members of the miR-29 family, which are down-regulated in the region of the heart adjacent to the infarct. The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression.

Vortioxetine received its first global approval for MDD in the USA in September 2013 and regulatory approval for its use in this indication in the EU (where it has received a positive opinion) and Canada is awaited.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of vortioxetine leading to this first approval for MDD. Vortioxetine was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. On the primary efficacy endpoint, both vortioxetine doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a mean difference to placebo (n=158) of -5.5 (vortioxetine 15 mg, P<0.0001, n=149) and -7.1 MADRS points (vortioxetine 20 mg, P<0.0001, n=151). The change in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was maintained throughout the study as reflected by a 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale total score of 8.2 at week 52 (from 17.6 at open-label baseline) in the observed case data set. Vortioxetine is a multi-modal antidepressant that functions as a human 5-HT3A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.  Approval for the treatment of MDD was based on a clinical development programme that included six positive 6-8 week studies, including one study in elderly people, and one positive maintenance study in adults. Vortioxetine represents another option for the treatment of MDD.  The multimodal compounds vortioxetine and vilazodone are examples of this approach with diverse mechanisms, and their different clinical effects will provide valuable insights into serotonergic modulation of glutamate transmission for the potential treatment of depression and associated cognitive dysfunction. Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5-HT1A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. Novel drugs in development include those that combine multiple simultaneous pharmacologic mechanisms in addition to SERT inhibition within the same molecule, such as vilazodone (combining 5HT1A partial agonism with SERT inhibition), triple reuptake inhibitors (combining norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition with SERT inhibition), and vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant combining actions at the G protein receptor mode (5HT1A and 5HT1B partial agonism and 5HT7 antagonism), at the ion channel mode (5HT3 antagonism) as well as the neurotransmitter transporter mode (SERT inhibition).  In this study of adults with MDD treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo.  However, on the basis of these findings, vortioxetine (2.5, 5, 10 mg/day) demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile and maintained effectiveness over 12 months of treatment.  In this study of adults with MDD, 5 mg vortioxetine did not differ significantly from placebo in reducing depression symptoms after 6 wk of treatment. After 8 weeks of treatment with Lu AA21004 10 mg, there was a significant reduction in HDRS-24 total score compared with placebo in adults with MDD. In conclusion, Lu AA21004 was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of elderly patients with recurrent major depressive disorder. Thus, Lu AA21004 was effective in preventing relapse of MDD and was well tolerated as maintenance treatment.  Findings on secondary outcome measures, using MMRM instead of LOCF, were supportive of likely efficacy for Lu AA21004 5mg and 10mg and duloxetine.

{"question": "Is the yeast Μac1 transcription factor induced upon copper deficiency?", "context": "Low-affinity copper transporter CTR2 is regulated by copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. The ablation of either MAC1 or AFT1 also abrogated CTR2 expression induced by copper depletion Our further study revealed that exogenous Aft1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Mac1p, whereas exogenous Mac1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Aft1p. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1 Although Mac1 activates the transcription of genes involved in high affinity copper uptake during periods of deficiency, little is known about the mechanisms by which Mac1 senses or responds to reduced copper availability.  The catalytic activity of Sod1 is essential for Mac1 activation and promotes a regulated increase in binding of Mac1 to copper response elements in the promoter regions of genomic Mac1 target genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper ions regulate gene expression through the two transcriptional activators, Ace1 and Mac1. Ace1 mediates copper-induced gene expression in cells exposed to stressful levels of copper salts, whereas Mac1 activates a subset of genes under copper-deficient conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. The yeast Mac1 protein is a copper-sensing transcription factor that is essential for both the activation and inactivation of genes required for high affinity copper ion transport. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  Copper-mediated repression of the activation domain in the yeast Mac1p transcription factor. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  In this study, we found that copper depletion can upregulate yeast CTR2 gene transcription while copper overload downregulate it. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?", "context": "Sequential chemoimmunotherapy of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide induction followed by alemtuzumab consolidation is effective in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia A central need in this historically refractory tumor is the controlled evaluation of multiagent chemotherapy and its combination with the currently most active single agent, alemtuzumab.  FMC-A is a safe and efficient protocol in T-PLL, which compares favorably to published data. Currently, the best treatment for T-PLL is IV alemtuzumab, which has resulted in very high response rates of more than 90% when given as frontline treatment and a significant improvement in survival.  The patient failed to respond to standard ALL induction chemotherapy, but achieved complete remission following treatment with a fludarabine and alemtuzumab-based regimen. Here we present a rare case of concurrent T-PLL and Kaposi sarcoma who achieved a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after a very short course of treatment with alemtuzumab.  Recent studies with single-agent alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, have shown improved response rates and survival in patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  The CD52 antigen is expressed at high density on the malignant T-cells and therapy with alemtuzumab, a humanized IgG1 antibody that targets this antigen, has produced promising results.  With the introduction of alemtuzumab, most patients who progressed despite treatment with pentostatin had a major response with a complete remission rate higher than that obtained with pentostatin when used as a first line. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Here we report the outcome of two patients with CD4-positive T cell prolymphocytic leukemia treated with CAMPATH-1H. Both patients responded rapidly to treatment and subsequently developed CD4 lymphopenia. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of 7.5 months. Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H.  CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months).  The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients.  For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. Overall response rate to FMC was 68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions. Alemtuzumab consolidation increased the intent-to-treat overall response rate to 92% (12 complete remissions; 11 partial remissions).", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?", "context": "Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas. Patients with tumors lacking hTERT expression/TA showed a significant survival benefit (Kaplan-Meier test, both P < .01), which, however, was based exclusively on the younger patient subgroup (≤60 y, both P < .005; >60 y, both ns).

{"question": "Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?", "context": "Thus far, results from two large phase 3 trial programs with bapineuzumab and solaneuzumab, respectively, have brought rather disappointing results. More recently, in phase III studies, bapineuzumab has been discontinued because it did not prove clinically effective (despite its significant effect on biomarkers), while solaneuzumab has been found effective in slowing AD progression.  Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Aβ is in late clinical development but recently the two most advanced mAbs, Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab, targeting an N-terminal or central epitope, respectively, failed to meet their target of improving or stabilizing cognition and function. The marginal effects observed in recent clinical studies of solanezumab, targeting monomeric Aβ, and bapineuzumab, targeting amyloid plaques, prompted expert comments that drug discovery efforts in Alzheimer's disease should focus on soluble forms of Aβ rather than fibrillar Aβ deposits found in amyloid plaques. Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Clinical trials on various drugs, including AN1792, bapineuzumab, and solanezumab, have been carried out; however, all trials have failed to demonstrate apparent clinical benefits.  Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3 immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline. Despite negative topline phase 3 clinical trial results for bapineuzumab and solanezumab in mild to moderate AD, findings from these trials and recent advances suggest renewed optimism for anti-amyloid therapies.  The lack of progress in the development of disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was highlighted recently by the cessation of a phase 3 clinical trial studying the effects of bapineuzumab on mild to moderate disease. No treatment benefit was apparent, whereas several serious side effects occurred more commonly in the treatment group compared to placebo.  Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-Aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of Aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of Aβ plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E ε4 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide.   The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E ϵ4 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug.  However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting Aβ may not be clinically efficacious in AD.  The patient received four bapineuzumab infusions over a 39 week period. During the course of this treatment, there was no remarkable change in cognitive impairment as determined by MMSE scores. Forty-eight days after the fourth bapineuzumab infusion was given, MRI revealed that the patient had developed lacunar infarcts and possible vasogenic edema, probably related to immunotherapy, but a subsequent MRI scan 38 days later demonstrated resolution of vasogenic edema. The patient expired due to acute congestive heart failure complicated by progressive AD and cerebrovascular accident 378 days after the first bapineuzumab infusion and 107 days after the end of therapy. Neuropathological and biochemical analysis did not produce evidence of lasting plaque regression or clearance of Aβ due to immunotherapy. These results suggest that, in this particular case, bapineuzumab immunotherapy neither resulted in detectable clearance of amyloid plaques nor prevented further cognitive impairment. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE ε4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use.  Bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, particularly in APOE 4 carriers, its ability to slow disease progression remains uncertain, and vasogenic edema - a dose-limiting and potentially severe adverse reaction - may limit its clinical applicability. The first is a phase 2 study of passive immunotherapy with bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminus of Abeta. This trial showed no differences within dose cohorts on the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory analyses showed potential treatment differences on cognitive and functional endpoints in study completers and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 noncarriers. A safety concern was the occurrence of reversible vasogenic edema.  The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}
{"question": "Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?", "context": "Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM) is a cardiac and skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the desmin (DES) gene. Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known. The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM. According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlargement and dilation of all heart compartments associated with serious decrease of its contractile function. DCM hallmark is the combination of dystrophic and hypertrophic alterations of cardiomyocytes. Since the power output of cardiac cells is directly related to remodeling of their contractile machinery we investigated expression of selected contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in the left ventricle of DCM patients using immunoblotting. The content of the recognized protein markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy such as tubulin, desmin and slow skeletal myosin heavy chain isoform, MHCbeta, was significantly elevated in DCM compared to normal myocardium. In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their synergistic roles in disease pathogenesis. A missense mutation in the desmin gene (DES) causes DCM in a human family. Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. Familial DCM is commonly inherited as autosomal dominant trait; less frequently it is autosomal recessive, X-linked or matrilinear. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Genes causally linked to this phenotype include dystrophin, dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, actin, desmin, beta-miosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and mitochondrial DNA genes, mostly transfer RNAs. Examination of families has identified so far eight disease genes, namely the dystrophin, tafazzin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, delta- sarcoglycan, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin T gene. Mutations of the desmin,   delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. Autosomal dominant DCM is the most frequent form (56% of our cases), and several candidate disease loci have been identified by linkage analysis. Three disease genes are presently known: the cardiac actin gene, the desmin gene, and the lamin A/C gene. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), whereas three other genes (actin, lamin A/C, and desmin) cause autosomal dominant DCM; Desmin defects were also recently identified in 1 familial dilated cardiomyopathy. By candidate gene screening, the molecular diagnosis can be provided for dystrophin, DAG, mitochondrial DNA, actin and desmin gene defects. Desmin (z-bands) are partly destroyed in DCM. Anti-desmin antibody titers as indicators of a possible secondary immune response are found high in patients with acute myocarditis declining during reconvalescence and are also elevated in DCM.

Nintedanib: evidence for its therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  In the Phase II TOMORROW trial, treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily showed a trend to slow the decline in lung function and significantly decrease acute exacerbations in patients with IPF, while showing an acceptable safety profile. The Phase III INPULSIS trials demonstrated a significant decrease in the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity in IPF patients treated with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily. In the INPULSIS-2 trial, the time to the first acute exacerbation significantly increased in IPF patients who were treated with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily.  Effects on collagen secretion were compared with those of the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, recently approved for IPF. Nintedanib, an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors has recently been shown, in two pivotal phase III studies, to effectively slow IPF disease progression. Consequently, nintedanib was given accelerated approval by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  Most recently, pirfenidone and nintedanib, two compounds with pleiotropic anti-fibrotic properties, have been proven effective in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF.  Meningococcal group B vaccine (Trumenba) to prevent more types of invasive meningococcal disease; antihemophilic factor (recombinant), porcine sequence (Obizur) to treat bleeding from acquired hemophilia A; and pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  More importantly, the period ends with the publication of two groundbreaking studies that confirmed that two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slowed disease progression, leading to a historic approval by the FDA.  Nintedanib (Ofev(®)) is an orally available, small, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cancer. Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of IPF, and for the second-line treatment in combination with docetaxel of locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma tumour histology.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of nintedanib leading to this first approval for IPF. Efficacy and safety of nintedanib in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib: a novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Reducing lung function decline in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: potential of nintedanib. These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150�mg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS� trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150�mg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5% and 18.6% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2% and 18.3% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nintedanib reduced the decline in FVC, which is consistent with a slowing of disease progression; nintedanib was frequently associated with diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of the study medication in less than 5% of patients.  A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

{"question": "Is pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?", "context": "As the syndrome occurred after the acute cholinergic syndrome but before organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy, the syndrome was called 'intermediate syndrome'. The characteristic features of the IMS are weakness of the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles and accessory muscles including neck muscles) and of proximal limb muscles. Accompanying features often include weakness of muscles innervated by some cranial nerves. It is now emerging that the degree and extent of muscle weakness may vary following the onset of the IMS.  Electrophysiological studies following OP poisoning have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').  Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is a sensory-motor distal axonopathy which usually occurs after exposure of certain OP insecticides. Neuropathies due to ingestion of OPs have rarely been reported in the literature. We report a patient with serious organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy due to malathion injection. The patient was a 32-year-old female who self-injected undetermined amounts of malathion over the median nerve trace on the forearm crease in a suicide attempt which resulted in peripheral neuropathy.  Acutely, these patients present with cholinergic crisis; intermediate syndrome and delayed polyneuropathy are other sequel of this form of poisoning. There was no strong evidence of irreversible peripheral nerve damage following acute OP poisoning, however further studies are required. Particular interactions are also addressed, such as those of pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors, the cumulative toxicity of organophosphates and organochlorines resulting in estrogenic effects and the promotion of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy. The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts.  These compounds cause four important neurotoxic effects in humans: the cholinergic syndrome, the intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND).  An 18-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were admitted to the hospital with weakness, paresthesia, and gait disturbances at 35 and 22 days, respectively, after ingesting dimethyl-2,2-dichloro vinyl phosphate (DDVP). Neurological examination revealed weakness, vibration sense loss, bilateral dropped foot, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilaterally positive Babinski sign. Electroneurography demonstrated distal motor polyneuropathy with segmental demyelination associated with axonal degeneration prominent in the distal parts of both lower extremities. Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority (3/7) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure. Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a rare toxicity resulting from exposure to certain organophosphorus (OP) esters.  Therefore, OPIDP may develop only after very large exposures to insecticides, causing severe cholinergic toxicity. Several studies have reported the occurrence of sensory neuropathy with exposure to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus insecticides, at levels not associated with overt toxicity.  We found no evidence of sensory neuropathy or isolated peripheral abnormalities among subjects with long-term chlorpyrifos exposure at levels known to be associated with the manufacturing process. Persistent, mainly motor, impairment of the peripheral nervous system was found in men two years after OP poisoning, in particular in severe occupational and intentional poisonings with neuropathic OPs. This finding is possibly due to remaining organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy. Besides the well known acute cholinergic toxicity, these compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring two to three weeks after the acute exposure.  Electromyography demonstrated motor weighed sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration significant in the distal parts of bilateral lower extremities.  The two cases are presented here since organophosphate poisonings are common in our country, and since late-onset polyneuropathy is not a well known clinical presentation as acute toxicity. The course of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) in humans has not been quantitatively measured in epidemiologic studies. The persistence of deficits in motor strength in all severely poisoned patients regardless of pesticide type was unexpected, and may reflect persistent cholinergic blockade or intermediate syndrome, neuropathy, or a combination of these. The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds.  Following accidental or suicidal exposure, these anticholinesterases lead to three well defined neurological syndromes i.e. initial life threatening acute cholinergic crisis which often requires management in intensive care unit, intermediate syndrome in which cranial nerve palsies, proximal muscle weakness and respiratory muscle weakness are common and patients often require respiratory support and delayed organophosphate induced polyneuropathy. [Late onset polyneuropathy due to exposure to organophosphates].  Less often a polyneuropathic syndrome of late onset may occur. On electromyography there was sensomotor peripheral polyneuropathy, which was primarily axonal and predominantly motor and distal. Peripheral nerve biopsy confirmed the presence of 'dying back' type axonopathy.  Agricultural workers chronically exposed to organophosphate insecticides, without adequate protection, have an increased risk of developing late onset neuropathy due to organophosphates.  Epidemiologic studies on pesticides have found associations with long-term effects on health mainly in three fields: cancer (especially hematological cancer), neurotoxic effects (polyneuropathy, neuro-behavioral hazards, Parkinson's disease), and reproductive disorders (infertility, birth defects, adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal mortality).  EMG studies showed evidence of partial denervation of the anterior tibial group of muscles and flexor digiti minimi in 2 of the 30 workers (6.7%) who underwent EMG examination. Neurological symptoms consist in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple sclerosis or M. Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia.  Thirty percent of patients had definite or possible exposure to organophosphate pesticides, and the peak use coincides with the peak incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These results suggest that previously reported cases of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy may represent only the worst disease in a spectrum of impairment, a sequela of exposure that may be much more common than previously thought. It is suggested that the main cause of nervous lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides. Delayed polyneuropathy develops within 1 to 3 weeks and abates after 6 to 12 months.  Isolated case reports have circumstantially linked the use of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to polyneuropathy. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is an unlikely cause of polyneuropathy. A patient is reported presenting a cerebellar disorder developing about 5 weeks after acute exposure to an organophosphate insecticide.  Less well known, but more complex and idiosyncratic, is the potential for some agents to produce a delayed and progressive polyneuropathy--Organophosphorus Induced Delayed Neurotox-icity (OPIDN).  It is also quite probable that human neurotoxicity may be a potential hazard from exposure to more than the handful of organophosphorus pesticides that have been described in the literature. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy. Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset. Nevertheless, we describe a patient with delayed polyneuropathy after suicidal ingestion of parathion.

In addition, compared to uninfected mixed cultures, activation of microglia in BDV-infected mixed cultures was associated with a significantly greater lipopolysaccharide-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10. Taken together, the present data are the first in vitro evidence that persistent BDV infection of neurons and astrocytes rather than direct exposure to the virus or dying neurons is critical for activating microglia. Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. Varied persistent life cycles of Borna disease virus in a human oligodendroglioma cell line. Borna disease virus (BDV) establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system of vertebrate animal species as well as in tissue cultures.  Thus, our findings show that BDV may have established a persistent infection at low levels of viral expression in OL cells with the possibility of a latent infection. These results suggested that BDV infection may cause direct damage in the developing brain by inhibiting the function of amphoterin due to binding by the p24 phosphoprotein. We describe a model for investigating disorders of central nervous system development based on neonatal rat infection with Borna disease virus, a neurotropic noncytolytic RNA virus.  Borna disease virus (BDV) replicates in brain cells. The neonatally infected rat with BDV exhibits developmental-neuromorphological abnormalities, neuronal cytolysis, and multiple behavioral and physiological alterations.  Borna disease virus (BDV) causes central nervous system (CNS) disease in several vertebrate species, which is frequently accompanied by behavioral abnormalities. Intrinsic responses to Borna disease virus infection of the central nervous system. Immune cells invading the central nervous system (CNS) in response to Borna disease virus (BDV) antigens are central to the pathogenesis of Borna disease (BD).  We report here the partial purification and characterization of cell-free BDV from the tissue culture supernatant of infected human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells. We have used the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique to gain insight into the pathogenesis of encephalitis caused by Borna disease virus (BDV).  In contrast, in the BDV-infected primary mixed cultures, we observed proliferation of microglia cells that acquired the round morphology and expressed major histocompatibility complex molecules of classes I and II.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

{"question": "Is there an association between bruxism and reflux?", "context": "Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0.05).  This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism.  The aim of this cross-over, randomized, single-blinded trial was to examine whether intra-esophageal acidification induces sleep bruxism (SB).  RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.  Chronic regurgitation of gastric acids in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may cause dental erosion, which can lead in combination with attrition or bruxism to extensive loss of coronal tooth tissue. This clinical report describes treatment of severe tooth wear of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient who is 54-year-old Turkish male patient. After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes.  The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.  These results suggest that most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position. Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?", "context": "To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US FDA-approved indication for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE). All SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and clomipramine) were effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms. Paroxetine has been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder (PD), generalised anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, whereas paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of MDD, SAD, PD and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects. Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. All these women had significant improvements in the HAMA, HAMD, CGI, and PRISM calendar. The rate of response to paroxetine treatment lay between 50% and 78.6% in the continuous-treatment group, and 37.5-93.8% in the intermittent-treatment group, as determined at the study end-point. The present results indicate that paroxetine is effective in both continuous and intermittent treatment of oriental PMDD women, and that the effects of active treatment lasted for six consecutive treatment menstrual cycles. Paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Continuous treatment with paroxetine reduced premenstrual symptoms effectively with a response rate of 85%. Intermittent treatment was as effective as continuous treatment in reducing irritability, affect lability, and mood swings, but had a somewhat weaker effect on depressed mood and somatic symptoms. Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores were lower in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group, although the differences were not statistically significant. However, the mean on-treatment Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (clinician-rated) score for the paroxetine group was 17.9 +/- 8.3 compared with 31.5 +/- 11.2 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference = 13.6, P = 0.009). Response (Clinical Global Impressions Scale score of 1 or 2) occurred in 70% of subjects randomized to paroxetine CR and 10% of those assigned to placebo (chi2(1) = 7.5, P = 0.006). The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada recently approved paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo. For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated. A statistically significant difference was observed in favor of paroxetine CR 25 mg versus placebo on the VAS-Mood (adjusted mean difference = -12.58 mm, 95% CI = -18.40 to -6.76; p < .001) and for paroxetine CR 12.5 mg versus placebo (adjusted mean difference = -7.51 mm, 95% CI = -13.40 to -1.62; p = .013). Paroxetine CR doses of 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day are effective in treating PMDD and are well tolerated. At end point, subjects treated with paroxetine CR (12.5 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated significant improvement in VAS-Mood scores compared with those who received placebo (paroxetine CR 12.5 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -8.7 mm; 95% CI, -15.7, -1.7; p =.015; paroxetine CR 25 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -12.1 mm; 95% CI, -18.9, -5.3; p <.001). Both doses of paroxetine CR 12.5 mg and 25 mg daily are effective and well tolerated in patients who suffer from PMDD. Of these agents, sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine (as an extended-release formulation) are approved by the US FDA for luteal phase, as well as continuous, administration. In well designed placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder (including a study in the elderly), social anxiety disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), paroxetine CR was consistently superior to placebo with regards to primary endpoints (i.e. mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score [major depressive disorder], Liebowitz social anxiety scale total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement score [social anxiety disorder] and Visual Analogue Scale-Mood score [PMDD]). Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo. Paroxetine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with currently approved indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Preliminary data suggest that paroxetine has potential in the treatment of social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. The effects of active treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14.9 (+/- 5.3) to 8.2 (+/- 4.9) in the first, 7.8 (+/- 5.1) in the second, and 7.8 (+/- 6.8) in the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17.6; p < 0.0001). The most conservative measure, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), revealed that 7 of 14 patients had a complete response (CGI = 1 or 2) whereas 4 patients had a partial response (CGI = 3). These open trial findings are consistent with the notion that paroxetine is effective in the acute phase for the treatment of PDD. The rating of premenstrual irritability, depressed mood, increase in appetite, and anxiety/tension was markedly lower during treatment with paroxetine than before, and this reduction in symptomatology appeared unabated for the entire treatment period.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the linker histone H1, Hho1p, has two domains that are similar in sequence to the globular domain of H1 (and variants such as H5) Two homologous domains of similar structure but different stability in the yeast linker histone, Hho1p Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single linker histone, Hho1p, with two globular domains.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p, with two globular domains, can simultaneously bind to two four-way junction DNA molecules Here, we show in yeast, that the presence of yeast linker histone Hho1p represses expression of a pol II transcribed gene (MET15) embedded in the rDNA. Yeast linker histone Hho1p is required for efficient RNA polymerase I processivity and transcriptional silencing at the ribosomal DNA Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p is not essential for cell viability, and very little is known about its function in vivo.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p functionally interacts with core histone H4 and negatively regulates the establishment of transcriptionally silent chromatin  Unlike canonical linker histones in higher eukaryotes that have a single conserved globular domain, Hho1p possesses two globular domains. We show that the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of Hho1p is dispensable for its function, suggesting that the mode of Hho1p action is similar to that of canonical linker histones To identify new proteins involved in spore nuclear organization, we purified chromatin from mature spores and discovered a significant enrichment of the linker histone (Hho1) Hho1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed increased genome-wide binding in mature spores and provides novel in vivo evidence of the linker histone binding to nucleosomal linker DNA One of the peculiarities of S. cerevisiae cells is the unusual and less abundant linker histone, Hho1p.

{"question": "Can protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?", "context": "The Alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution. Thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from Alu elements. More than 25% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes. his study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation. Our data suggests that lineage-specific exonization events should be determined by the combination event of the formation of splicing sites and protection against site-specific mutation pressures. These evolutionary mechanisms could be major sources for primate diversification. Exonization of Alu elements creates primate-specific genomic diversity Our data show that, once acquired, some exonizations were lost again in some lineages. In general, Alu exonization occurred at various time points over the evolutionary history of primate lineages, and protein-coding potential was acquired either relatively soon after integration or millions of years thereafter. Once integrated, they have the potential to become exapted as functional modules, e.g., as protein-coding domains via alternative splicing. This particular process is also termed exonization and increases protein versatility alternative \"Alu-exons\" also carry the potential to greatly enhance genetic diversity by increasing the transcriptome of primates chiefly via alternative splicing. ere, we report a 5' exon generated from one of the two alternative transcripts in human tumor necrosis factor receptor gene type 2 (p75TNFR) that contains an ancient Alu-SINE, which provides an alternative N-terminal protein-coding domain.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

The molecular modelling showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR.  Juice consumption significantly improved resistance of LDL+VLDL-C to Cu(2+)-mediated oxidation (P = 0.039), HDL-C (47.3 ± 15.8 to 51.7 ± 14.8 mg/dL, P<0.001), and the ratio of total-C/HDL-C (4.25 ± 1.59 to 3.63 ± 1.16, P<0.001) at 8 wk.

The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.

{"question": "Is progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?", "context": "BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.  The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50.4% with progesterone, as compared with 50.5% with placebo. Mortality was similar in the two groups. No relevant safety differences were noted between progesterone and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.  There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35). Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; CI, 1.96 to 4.66).  CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI.  Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. RESULTS: There was a better recovery rate and GOS score for the patients who were given progesterone than for those in the control group in a 3-months follow-up period (50% vs. 21%); subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug. While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending.  All three studies reported the effects of progesterone on mortality. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up was 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone to be 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. GOS was classified to 2 main categories of favorable and unfavorable recovery, of which, favorable recovery in placebo, progesterone, and progesterone-vitamin D was 25%, 45%, and 60%, respectively which showed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The results showed that recovery rate in patients with severe brain trauma in the group receiving progesterone and vitamin D together was significantly higher than that of progesterone group, which was in turn higher than that of placebo group.  The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up is 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone was 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury.  Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  The modified Functional Independence Measure scores in the progesterone group were higher than those in the placebo group at both 3-month and 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The mortality rate of the progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  These data, combined with the results of the previously published ProTECT trial, show progesterone to be safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of TBI. Larger phase III trials will be necessary to verify results prior to clinical implementation. CONCLUSION: It indicated that successive early application of PG will benefit the patients with acute severe head injury by improving the recovery and reducing the disability, which may be related to its alleviating inflammatory and lipid peroxidation response. Adverse and serious adverse event rates were similar in both groups, except that patients randomized to progesterone had a lower 30-day mortality rate than controls (rate ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.99).  However, moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this small study, progesterone caused no discernible harm and showed possible signs of benefit. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries A US National Institutes of Health-sponsored, nationwide Phase III clinical trial is now evaluating progesterone for moderate-to-severe TBI in 1200 patients An industry-sponsored Phase III international trial is also under way, and planning for a trial using progesterone to treat pediatric brain injury has begun More than two decades of pre-clinical research and two recent clinical trials have shown that progesterone (PROG) and its metabolites exert beneficial effects after traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a number of metabolic and physiological pathways that can reduce damage in many different tissues and organ systems After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries RESULTS: Analysis of these reviews yielded meanfuling observations: (1) The effectiveness of most ordinary treatments in TBI is inconclusive except that corticosteroids are likely to be ineffective or harmful, and tranexamic acid, nimodipine and progesterone show a promising effect in bleeding trauma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI or severe TBI. Laboratory data strongly show that progesterone treatment after TBI reduces edema, improves outcomes, and restores blood-brain barrier function.

Mutations in the GARS gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2D and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V - allelic disorders characterized by predominantly distal upper extremity weakness and atrophy, typically beginning during the second decade of life.  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene (GARS). The 13 genes known to be associated with the CMT2 subtypes are KIF1B (CMT2A1), MFN2 (CMT2A2), RAB7A (formerly RAB7) (CMT2B), LMNA (CMT2B1), MED25 (CMT2B2), TRPV4 (CMTC), GARS (CMT2D), NEFL (CMT2E/1F), HSPB1 (CMT2F), MPZ (CMT2I/J), GDAP1 (CMT2H/K), HSPB8 (CMT2L), and AARS (CMT2N).   The diagnosis of GARS-associated axonal neuropathy is based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), and molecular genetic testing of GARS, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Sporadic juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity or Hirayama's disease (HD) and autosomal dominant motor distal neuronopathy/axonopathy (CMT2D/dSMA-V), produced by glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene mutations, share some clinical features including: young age of onset, predilection for the distal upper extremity, asymmetry, sparing of proximal muscles and unusual cold sensitivity.  Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) type 2 presenting with predominant hand involvement, also known as CMT2D and Silver syndrome (SS) are rare phenotypically overlapping diseases which can be caused by mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) and in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase encoding (GARS) genes.  We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V.

{"question": "Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?", "context": "ALM is the most common type of melanoma amongst Asians, Africans, ALM develops on palmar, plantar, and subungual skin, and its biology is different from that of other cutaneous melanomas, where sunlight is the major known environmental determinant We present four albinos with histologic diagnoses of skin cancer Four Nigerian albinos (two men and two women) with skin cancer The sites of the lesions included the head [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in two patients and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in one patient] and the upper limb (melanoma wenty-nine patients (18 males and 11 females) with skin cancer were identified Kaposi sarcoma associated with HIV represented 81.8 percent of KS cases found. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranked second and malignant melanoma third Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors. Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a pediatric rarity world-wide, but perhaps more so in black Africans. To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Malignant melanomas in black Africans are predominantly located on the lower extremities Thus, our findings indicate that melanomas located on the lower extremities in black Africans show several features of aggressiveness; in particular, the proliferative activity was high, and p16 alterations was frequent as evidenced by loss of protein staining. Our findings also indicated that the diagnosis is delayed among black Africans. Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians, but the ratio of their incidence rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma to that of squamous cell carcinoma is larger than the corresponding ratio for Caucasians. ( Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas. This is probably also true for albino and normally pigmented Caucasians. Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years (range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion could not be found. The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease The outcome of treatment in 40 black patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age 62.9 years) with plantar melanoma over a 13-year period was analysed Delay in presentation and locally advanced disease may explain the poor prognosis of plantar melanoma in black South Africans. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over 3 years (1984 to 1987) were analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. Populations of African descent were found to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the sole of the foot. Pathological features of twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma studied in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during the period January, 1974 to December, 1975 are presented. Malignant melanoma accounted for 2.4% of all tumours and 4.5% of all malignant tumours, greatest age incidence being in the fifth to seventh decades. 81% melanomas occurred on the sole of feet validating the hypothesis that the pigmented skin in Africans is resistant to malignant melanoma.

{"question": "Is there a crystal structure of the full-length of the flaviviridae NS5(Methyltransferase - RNA depended RNA Polymerase) ?", "context": "flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal ≈ 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part. One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.  (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested. West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication. Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined. To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides. Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors. Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp. The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Clomipramine likewise interacted with SERTs and NETs but also with several other receptors types, while citalopram and reboxetine were preferential ligands of SERTs and NETs, respectively. In conclusion, S33005 interacts potently with SERTs and, less markedly, with NETs.  Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Serotonergic effects occur with lower doses, whereas both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects occur with higher doses of venlafaxine. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE.

{"question": "Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?", "context": "Gene expression regulation through the interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications is well-established, although the knowledge about the function of epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease is still largely unexplored. The study of epigenetic markers is, therefore, a very promising frontier of science which may aid in a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of gene expression in the biomolecule pathways linked to cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodeling and histone modifications play key roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease through (re)programming of cardiovascular (stem) cells commitment, identity and function. Notably, multiple subunits of switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified as strong candidates underlying these defects because they physically and functionally interact with cardiogenic transcription factors critical to cardiac development, such as TBX5, GATA-4, and NKX2-5. While these studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells. Recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulation of cardiovascular development at the chromatin level, including the remodeling of chromatin and the modification of histones. Chromatin-level regulation integrates multiple inputs and coordinates broad gene expression programs. Thus, understanding chromatin-level regulation will allow for a better appreciation of gene regulation as a whole and may set a fundamental basis for cardiovascular disease. Genetic and epigenetic factors are of great importance in cardiovascular biology and disease. Tobacco-smoking, one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors, is itself partially determined by genetic background and is associated with altered epigenetic patterns. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and miRNA, are critical for regulating developmental events. However, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms may lead to pathological consequences such as cardiovascular disease (CAD), neurodegenerative disease, obesity, metabolic disorder, bone and skeletal diseases and various cancers. Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached from the epigenetic perspective, including those associated with atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia and shear stress, among many others. With increasing interest and expanding partnerships in the field, we can expect new insights to emerge from epigenetic perspectives of cardiovascular health. Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations of the genome, which can govern gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The purpose of this review is to render an overview of the possible mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to environmental pollutants leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). From varied study approaches directed either toward the general understanding of the key pathway regulatory genes, or sampling population cohorts for global and gene-specific changes, it has been possible to identify several epigenetic signatures of environmental exposure relevant to CVD. An understanding of chromatin remodelling in response to environmental stimuli conducive to CVD is emerging, with the promise of novel diagnostic and therapeutic candidates. Consolidated knowledge is accumulating as to the role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of vascular development and vascular tone as well as in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The modulation of gene expression through modification of the epigenome by structural changes of the chromatin architecture without alterations of the associated genomic DNA sequence is part of the cellular response to environmental changes. Such environmental conditions, which are finally being translated into adaptations of the cardiovascular system, also comprise pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Histone modifications lead to the modulation of the expression of genetic information through modification of DNA accessibility. In addition, RNA-based mechanisms (e.g., microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) influence the development of disease. We here outline the recent work pertaining to epigenetic changes in a cardiovascular disease setting. Epigenetics may represent one of the possible scientific explanations of the impact of such intrauterine risk factors for the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA alterations, which collectively enable the cell to respond quickly to environmental changes. A number of CVD risk factors, such as nutrition, smoking, pollution, stress, and the circadian rhythm, have been associated with modification of epigenetic marks. Further examination of these mechanisms may lead to earlier prevention and novel therapy for CVD.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease.

{"question": "Does cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?", "context": "During the subacute phase, the irreversible damage expands into the penumbra: multiple electrical and biological signals are triggered by periinfarct, spreading depression-like depolarizations leading to hypoxia and stepwise increase in lactate. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that waves of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) appearing in the ischemic penumbra contribute to secondary lesion growth. Analysis of MCA occlusions (MCAOs) revealed a first CSD wave starting off during ischemic decline at the emerging core region, propagating concentrically over large portions of left cortex. Subsequent recurrent waves of CSD did not propagate concentrically but preferentially circled around the ischemic core. In the vicinity of the core region, CSDs were coupled to waves of predominantly vasoconstrictive CBF(LSF) responses, resulting in further decline of CBF in the entire inner penumbra and in expansion of the ischemic core. We conclude that CSDs and corresponding CBF responses follow a defined spatiotemporal order, and contribute to early evolution of ischemic territories. Astrocytes in the metabolically compromised ischemic penumbra-like area showed a long lasting swelling response to spontaneous spreading depolarizations despite rapid dendritic recovery in a photothrombotic occlusion model of focal stroke. Spontaneous spreading depolarizations (SDs) occur in the penumbra surrounding ischemic core. These SDs, often referred to as peri-infarct depolarizations, cause vasoconstriction and recruitment of the penumbra into the ischemic core in the critical first hours after focal ischemic stroke; however, the real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of SD-induced injury to synaptic circuitry in the penumbra remain unknown. We propose that metabolic stress resulting from recurring SDs facilitates acute injury at the level of dendrites and dendritic spines in metabolically compromised tissue, expediting penumbral recruitment into the ischemic core. Although the mechanism remains unknown, SDs show delayed electrophysiological recovery within the ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. We conclude that in focal ischemia, transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression (SD) has been demonstrated following focal ischemia, and the additional workload imposed by SD on a tissue already compromised by a marked reduction in blood flow may contribute to the evolution of irreversible damage in the ischemic penumbra. While the changes in the glucose-related metabolites persisted during recovery even in anterior portions of the cortex in both groups in the aftermath of the SD, the magnitude of the changes was greater in the penumbra than in the normal cortex. SD appears to impose an equivalent increase in energy demands in control and ischemic brain, but the ability of the penumbra to recover from the insult is compromised. Thus, increasing the energy imbalance in the penumbra after multiple SDs may hasten the deterioration of the energy status of the tissue and eventually contribute to terminal depolarization and cell death, particularly in the penumbra. It is suggested that the limited survival of the penumbra is due to periinfarct depolarizations, which result in repeated episodes of tissue hypoxia, because the increased metabolic workload is not coupled to an adequate increase of collateral blood supply. Transient decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water as measured by fast diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the ischemic border zone are thought to reflect cellular swelling associated with spreading depression. Severely delayed recovery time after spreading depression is thought to represent the ischemic penumbra. One current but controversial hypothesis is that this penumbra tissue often eventually dies because of the metabolic stress imposed by multiple cortical spreading depression (CSD) waves, that is, by ischemic depolarizations. After simulated infarction, the model displays the linear relation between final infarct size and the number of CSD waves traversing the penumbra that has been reported experimentally, although damage with each individual wave progresses nonlinearly with time. These findings support the hypothesis that CSD waves play an important causal role in the death of ischemic penumbra tissue. MCAO also triggers periodic periinfarction depolarizing waves (PIDs) in the ischemic penumbra, the territory of salvage. Here, the effects of SD at reduced flow conditions as encountered in the ischemic penumbra are examined. The experiments illustrate how peri-infarct depolarizations may detrimentally affect the penumbra. In the second series of experiments, periinfarct depolarizations (PIDs) were recorded with an extracellular DC electrode at two locations in the ischemic penumbra for the initial 3 h following MCAO. In vivo two-photon microscopy of green fluorescent protein-expressing neurons in this penumbra-like area at risk revealed that SDs were temporally correlated with rapid (<6 s) dendritic beading.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?", "context": "The membrane protein complex between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN) controls Ca(2+) transport in cardiomyocytes, thereby modulating cardiac contractility. β-Adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 enhances SERCA activity via an unknown mechanism. Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle. In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels. Regulation of the SERCA calcium pump by phospholamban (PLB) is largely due to interactions between their respective transmembrane domains. In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA. Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) 2a is responsible for Ca(2+) up-take by this organelle and is inhibited in a reversible manner by phospholamban, another SR membrane protein. Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation These findings suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity. The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood.   Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. Phospholamban expressed in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin expressed in skeletal muscle regulate SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles. Regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (PLB). When PLB is phosphorylated, its inhibitory effect towards SERCA 2a is relieved, leading to an enhanced myocardial performance.   Ca(2+) reuptake occurs via sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and is regulated by the inhibitory protein phospholamban (PLB) in many cell types. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) is the endogenous inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), the integral membrane enzyme responsible for 70�% of the removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol, inducing cardiac muscle relaxation in humans. Phospholamban (PLB) is an integral membrane protein regulating Ca(2+) transport through inhibitory interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA).

{"question": "Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioma patients?", "context": "Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas. Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis showed that TERT promoter mutation (P=0.037), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation (P<0.001), and 1p/19q codeletion (P<0.001) were associated with favorable overall survival (OS). In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004). Consistent with this observation, in the subset of 97 IDH-mutated astrocytomas, 14 TERT promoter-mutated tumors showed longer PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). In contrast, among the subset of 74 IDH wild-type lower-grade gliomas with intact 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation was associated with shorter PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). Similarly, in the subset of 65 IDH wild-type astrocytomas, 16 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited unfavorable PFS (P=0.007) and OS (P=0.008). Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas. RESULTS: TERTp-mut identified in 60.8% of gliomas (491 out of 807) was globally associated with poorer outcome (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.50).  TERT promoter mutations lead to high transcriptional activity under hypoxia and temozolomide treatment and predict poor prognosis in gliomas. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age. TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit TERT promoter mutations alone predominately have primary GBMs associated with poor median OS (11.5 months). Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit IDH1/2 mutations alone predominately have astrocytic morphologies and exhibit a median OS of 57 months while patients whose tumors exhibit both TERT promoter and IDH1/2 mutations predominately exhibit oligodendroglial morphologies and exhibit median OS of 125 months. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.CONCLUSION: TERT promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas.  In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004).  The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among patients who had gliomas with only IDH mutations and was highest (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only TERT mutations. The molecular groups were independently associated with overall survival among patients with grade II or III gliomas but not among patients with grade IV gliomas. Mutations were detected in gliomas, but not in meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, cavernomas, intracranial metastases, normal brain tissues, or peripheral blood of glioma patients. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Does ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?", "context": "Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by omega-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by omega-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels.  Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.   Binding assay for both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the N-terminal half are important for the recognition of N-type channels, whereas essential residues for P/Q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. Ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals. Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). The therapeutic benefit of ziconotide derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide, a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, with morphine on nociception in rats. Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain. Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain. Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs. Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers. The selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration. A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain. As the clinically available analgesics, pregabalin (alpha2delta-subunit calcium channel ligand), ziconotide (N-type calcium channel blocker), mexiletine (sodium channel blocker), and duloxetine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) were evaluated in these neurochemically-induced allodynia models. The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain. Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel by intrathecal administration of the channel-specific blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) is efficacious in the treatment of severe chronic pain. Ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses. In conclusion, present findings provide implication that the spinal anti-nociceptive mechanistic site of pregabalin is different from that of ziconotide, mexiletine, and duloxetine, and pregabalin could have a broader anti-nociceptive mechanism other than N-type calcium channel blockade. Ziconotide (SNX-111), a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, is antinociceptive when it is administered intrathecally. Effects of intrathecal administration of ziconotide, a selective neuronal N-type calcium channel blocker, on mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in a rat model of postoperative pain. A state-dependent Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor may provide an improved therapeutic window over ziconotide, the peptidyl Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor used clinically.  There is also human validation data from ziconotide, the CaV2.2-selective peptidyl inhibitor used clinically to treat refractory pain.  A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.

{"question": "Is stop codon bypass possible?", "context": "In 1999, proof-of-concept for treating these disorders was obtained in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, when administration of aminoglycosides restored protein translation by inducing the ribosome to bypass a PTC. Aminoglycosides can bypass nonsense mutations and are the prototypic agents for translational bypass therapy (TBT). Expression of retroviral replication enzymes (Pol) requires a controlled translational recoding event to bypass the stop codon at the end of gag. This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift). Recent studies on translation termination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have not only enabled the identification of the key components of the termination machinery, but have also revealed several regulatory mechanisms that might enable the controlled synthesis of C-terminally extended polypeptides via stop-codon readthrough.  The effects of all possible single-base mutations in the codons flanking the stop indicated that 3' contexts of the form CAR-YYA confer leakiness and that the 3' context permits read through of UAA and UGA stop codons as well as UAG. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which ribosomes bypass leaky stop codons in vivo, we have devised a system in which readthrough is coupled to the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in tobacco protoplasts.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation by genetically selected peptide aptamers that functionally antagonize E2F activity. Accumulating work over the past decade has shown that peptide aptamer screening represents a valid strategy for inhibitor identification that can be applied to a variety of different targets.  . The target of one inhibitor peptide, Pep80, identified in this screen was determined to be Snapin, a protein associated with the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) complex that is critical for calcium-dependent exocytosis during neurotransmission.

These results indicate that the CaSR expression of myocardium is reduced in the progress of DCM, and its potential mechanism is related to the impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis. calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays important roles in cardiac electrical activity and calcium homeostasis. NCX current (I(NCX)) shows transmural gradient across left ventricle in many species. Previous studies demonstrated that NCX expression was increased and transmural gradient of I(NCX) was disrupted in failing heart calcium homeostasis, the key process underlying excitation-contraction coupling The results indicate the calcium handling properties of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are relatively immature to hESC counterparts Our understanding of the molecular processes which regulate cardiac function has grown immeasurably in recent years. Even with the advent of β-blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and calcium modulating agents, heart failure (HF) still remains a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition. Here, we review the molecular changes which occur in the heart in response to increased load and the pathways which control cardiac hypertrophy, calcium homeostasis, and immune activation during HF. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are G-protein coupled receptors which maintain systemic calcium homeostasis and participate in hormone secretion, activation of ion channels, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. CaSRs are associated with I/R injury and apoptosis in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes via suppressing Bcl-2 and promoting caspase-3 expression. Important insights into the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related diseases have been gained by studying families with inherited cardiac hypertrophy. Integrated clinical and genetic investigations have demonstrated that different genetic defects can give rise to the common phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy. Diverse pathways have been identified, implicating perturbations in force generation, force transmission, intracellular calcium homeostasis, myocardial energetics, and cardiac metabolism in causing disease HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival. Calcium ions are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart. this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure With aging, the heart develops myocyte hypertrophy associated with impaired relaxation indices. To define the cellular basis of this adaptation, we examined the physiological changes that arise in calcium handling in the aging heart and contrasted the adaptations that occur following the imposition of a stimulus that alters calcium homeostasis in a young and an old heart alterations in the calcium-handling machinery of the cardiocyte differ in the context of age and as such may predispose the older heart to the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. The cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart.  Thus exchanger overexpression in mice leads to abnormal calcium handling and a decompensatory transition to heart failure with stress Central to controlling intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) are a number of Ca(2+) transporters and channels with the L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) being of particular note in the heart. This review concentrates on the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiac muscle and the homeostatic mechanisms employed to ensure that the heart can operate under steady-state conditions on a beat by beat basis. the tight regulation of SR Ca(2+) content is also required to prevent the abnormal, spontaneous or diastolic release of Ca(2+) from the SR. Such diastolic events are a major factor contributing to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias in disease situations and in recently identified familial mutations in the SR Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR). Calcium channels have a unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity, they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodelling.  Cardiac calcium (Ca(2+)) handling subsumes the mechanisms maintaining the myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis that contribute essentially to cardiac performance.

In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells. Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells.

We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is the most common cause of vision loss among the elderly. Stem-cell-based strategies, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), may provide an abundant donor source for generating RPE cells in cell replacement therapies. This study contributes to our understanding of the utility of hESC/hiPSC-derived RPE in AMD therapy. Two important early potential hESC applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness.

{"question": "Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?", "context": "An integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs. Three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks (approximately 50, 70, and 90%) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions. The ability of hexamethonium (C6) to reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine (Tc) Volatile anesthetics enhance the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs). The neuromuscular junction is a postulated site of this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. Subsequently, inhibitory effects of NDMRs were studied in the presence of the volatile anesthetics at a concentration equivalent to half the concentration producing a 50% inhibition alone. All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition. The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner.  As further evidence of anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos (1-100 microM) was able to reverse the blockade by d-tubocurarine There was an initial partial reversal of the neuromuscular inhibition caused by tubocurarine Isoflurane and sevoflurane enhance the receptor blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because other purinergic 2X (P2X) receptor antagonists, NF023 and NF279, do not have the reverse effects on the neuromuscular blockade of d-TC, the effect of NF449 seems irrelevant to inhibition of P2X receptors.

{"question": "Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?", "context": "Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. This study was designed to determine the significance of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in DNA hypermethylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify DNA methylation markers in serum for the early diagnosis of ESCC. DNA methyltransferase 1 as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in gastric cancer. We examined the prognostic and predictive impact of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. High DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was found in 105/127 (83%) and 79/127 (62%) carcinomas, respectively. Tumoral DNMT3b mRNA up-regulation was significantly correlated with hypermethylation of multiple tumor-related genes (P=0.021). A regulator of de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L promoter was found to have lost DNA methylation to varying levels in 14 out of 15 cancer cervix samples analysed. The present study highlights the importance of DNA methylation profile at DNMT3L promoter not only as a promising biomarker for cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, but also provides insight into the possible role of DNMT3L in cancer development. DNMT3L is a novel marker and is essential for the growth of human embryonal carcinoma. Among the DNMT genes, we found that mRNA for DNMT3L was specifically expressed in TGCTs, but neither in normal testicular tissues nor in cancer cells of somatic tissue origin. DNMT3L protein was strongly expressed in two EC cell lines, but not in the cell lines of somatic tissue origin. Positive nuclear labeling for DNMT3a was found only in few neoplasms: 1 pleomorphic adenoma (9.0%), 2 adenoid cystic carcinoma (16.6%) and 1 mucoepidermoid (9.0%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results were not able to demonstrate a clear correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3a immunoexpression and salivary gland neoplasms development. DNA methylation, mediated by the combined action of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), is essential for mammalian development and is a major contributor to cellular transformation. The prevalence, the prognostic effect, and interaction with other molecular markers of DNMT3A mutations was studied in 415 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than 60 years. The recent identification of DNMT3A mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia prompted us to determine their frequency, patterns and clinical impact in a cohort of 98 patients with either therapy-related or secondary acute myeloid leukemia developing from an antecedent hematologic disorder. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were also decreased in vorinostat-treated A549 cancer cells. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the primary enzyme that maintains DNA methylation. 5-Azactydine inhibits cell growth by direct cytotoxic action as well as by inhibition of DNA methyl transferase enzyme. Alterations in metabolism of methyl donors, disturbances in activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases, and presence of DNA single-strand breaks could contribute to the loss of cytosine methylation during carcinogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms of genomic hypomethylation induced by chemical carcinogens remain largely unknown. Recently, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3B promoter region, C46359T (-149C>T), -283T>C, and -579G>T have also been reported to be stratification markers that can predict an individual's susceptibility to cancers. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. Thus, tumour subsets exist that display concurrent decreased BRCA1 expression, BRCA1 promoter methylation, cytoplasmic CTCF expression and with DNMT3b over-expression. DNA methylation patterns in genome are maintained during replication by a DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. To investigate the relationship between the expression of DNMT and clinical prognosis in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL), the mRNA expressions of DNMT, p15(INK4B), mdr1 were measured in 72 AL patients and 20 normal controls by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the ratio of p15 CpG land methylation was measured in 56 AL patients and 14 normal controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR). DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 ensures clonal transmission of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns in a mammalian genome during replication. Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival. DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns via complicated networks including signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, relating to cell differentiation or carcinogenesis.

{"question": "Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?", "context": "Statins have been shown in two recent small phase I/II trials to be associated with a marked reduction in clinical and transcranial Doppler (TCD) evidence of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).  Statins did not result in reduced TCD velocities, clinical or angiographic vasospasm, or improvements in global outcome at the time of hospital discharge.  There remains significant uncertainty as to the role of statins in preventing vasospasm after SAH. Although the results of 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH, retrospective studies have failed to confirm this. There were no differences in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (25.3 vs 30.5%; p = 0.277), in-hospital mortality rate (18 vs 15%; p = 0.468), length of hospitalization (21 +/- 15 vs 19 +/- 12 days; p = 0.281), or poor outcome at discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale Scores 1-2: 21.7 vs 18.2%; p = 0.416) between the simvastatin and nonstatin cohorts.  The uniform introduction of simvastatin did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, death, or poor outcome in patients with aSAH. Simvastatin was well tolerated, but its benefit may be less than has been previously reported. Cholesterol-reducing agents might improve unfavourable outcomes. We cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of lowering cholesterol in aneurysmal SAH because of insufficient reliable evidence from only one small trial. Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was an improvement in the functional outcome in the simvastatin group at 1, 3 or 6 months in the follow-up; however, this difference was not statistically significant.  There was benefit of simvastatin in terms of reduction in clinical vasospasm, mortality or improved functional outcome, however, this was not statistically significant. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity, however, is significantly improved after long-term statin administration in most patients with severe small vessel disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or impaired baseline CA. Atorvastatin decreases computed tomography and S100-assessed brain ischemia after subarachnoid aneurysmal hemorrhage: a comparative study. In the overall population, cerebral vasospasm was significantly less common in the statin-treated group. Severity of vasospasm, as assessed on the most severe angiogram, was lowered with statin. Statins significantly reduced volume of ischemia in patients with vasospasm and an uncomplicated coiling procedure. S100B levels were significantly lower in statin-treated patients, and the decrease was greatest among high-grade patients (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 3-5). No differences were found between statin-treated and untreated groups regarding rescue therapy intensity or 1-yr clinical outcomes. Atorvastatin reduces the incidence, the severity and the ischemic consequences of vasospasm as assessed on computed tomography. In high-grade World Federation of Neurological Surgeons patients, atorvastatin decreases serum levels of S100B, a biomarker of brain ischemia. Despite these positive effects on biomarkers, no improvement of outcome was seen in the overall population, although there was a tendency for a better clinical outcome in high-grade patients. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage, but with an increased risk of incidental spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Statins are known to have pleiotropic vascular effects, some of which may interrupt the pathogenesis of DNDs. Based on promising preliminary reports, many clinicians routinely administer statins to prevent DNDs. However, observational studies have not revealed an association between statin-use and reduced DNDs or improved neurological outcomes. Results of RCTs have been inconsistent and limited by small sample size, but together suggest that statins may reduce DNDs, with no clear impact on mortality or neurological recovery. the role of statins in the management of patients with SAH remains unclear. Although promising, statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care. In patients with SAH, they may decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, although the effects on overall outcome are less clear. Statins treatment may have potential clinical impact in vascular disease beyond cholesterol lowering. Its benefits have been documented in cerebral ischaemia and in subarachnoid haemorrhage. A recent meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage reported a reduced incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality in statin-treated patients. The results of the present systematic review do not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as reported in a previous meta-analysis. Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).  Recently, two randomized controlled phase II studies showed that acute initiation of statin treatment directly after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) decreases the incidence of radiologic vasospasm and clinical signs of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and even reduces mortality. We conclude that both the primary and secondary outcome results of this study do not support a beneficial effect of simvastatin in patients with SAH. Novel uses of their anti-inflammatory properties in sepsis and vasomotor properties in subarachnoid haemorrhage are being further investigated by randomised trials. A trend towards a lower mortality within 14 days in patients receiving solely simvastatin and those receiving statin and magnesium as compared with the control group was found.  Initiation of statin therapy after aneurysmal SAH significantly reduces the incidence of vasospasm, delayed ischemic deficits, and mortality. The addition of statins to standard care was not associated with any reduction in the development of vasospasm or improvement in outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  We have previously demonstrated that acute pravastatin therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ameliorates vasospasm-related delayed ischemic deficits.  This trial demonstrates that acute statin treatment reduces traditional rescue therapy for vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Improvement in early outcome has proved robust at 6 months, particularly in relation to physical and psychosocial (Short Form 36) outcome. The authors previously have demonstrated that acute treatment with pravastatin after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can ameliorate vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs). The neuroprotective effects of acute treatment with pravastatin following aneurysmal SAH are associated with enhancement of autoregulation Simvastatin reduces vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: results of a pilot randomized clinical trial. The use of simvastatin as prophylaxis against delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH is a safe and well-tolerated intervention. Its use attenuates serum markers associated with brain injury and decreases the incidence of radiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficit. Acute treatment with pravastatin after aSAH is safe and ameliorates cerebral vasospasm, improves cerebral autoregulation, and reduces vasospasm-related DID.  SAH statin users demonstrated significant improvement in 14-day functional outcome, a significantly lower incidence of DCI and cerebral infarctions of any type, as well as prevention of TCD highest mean velocity elevation.

{"question": "Does molindone affect body weight?", "context": "Mean weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2).  A large-scale trial comparing a first-generation antipsychotic (molindone) with newer agents did not find significant differences in treatment response, although the newer antipsychotics were associated with more severe weight gain.  No agent demonstrated superior efficacy, and all were associated with side effects, including weight gain.  The three treatment arms did not significantly differ in symptom decrease or time to discontinuation. Akathisia was more common with molindone and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment.  Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater weight gain. Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin, and liver transaminase levels. Molindone led to more self-reports of akathisia.  Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).  Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).  Convergent evidence suggests a hierarchy in the magnitude of BWG that may be induced by diverse agents, being very high for clozapine and olanzapine; high for quetiapine, zotepin, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine; moderate for risperidone and sertindole; and low for ziprazidone, amisulpiride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide, and molindone.  Loxapine and molindone induce weight decreases, and these exceptions are difficult to explain. It is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but causes significantly more weight loss (RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99). Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic; however, its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics, apart from the event of weight loss.  Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. Weight gain has been reported with nearly every antipsychotic drug on the market (molindone is an exception).  Although almost all antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce bodyweight loss.  Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known.  On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds.  Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents  Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs. We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups.  The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. There was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Could Arimidex (anastrozole) cause hot flashes?", "context": "More than a third of breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment report joint pain. In the first 6 weeks, emergence of joint pain was associated with increase in general pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased sexual activity. Antiestrogen therapy can cause vasomotor symptoms similar to those occurring during menopause, including hot flashes. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for treatment of hot flashes in Korean patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen therapy. 10 patients with breast cancer who were undergoing antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or anastrozole and who were suffering from hot flashes. During treatment, severity of hot flashes was reduced by 70%-95% in all patients. anastrozole has been widely used in Japan as an adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal, hormone-responsive breast cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of bone fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) during anastrozole treatment in Japanese patients. Musculoskeletal disorders were the most common (26.1 %), and hot flashes were the second most common adverse event (7.9 %). To compare the effect of therapy with anastrozole versus a combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole in women in first relapse of endocrine-responsive breast cancer. fulvestrant loading dose (LD) regimen followed by monthly injection plus 1 mg of anastrozole daily or to 1 mg of anastrozole daily alone. Incidences of prespecified adverse events (AEs) were similar. Hot flashes were more common in the experimental arm: 63 patients (24.6%) versus 35 patients (13.8%) in the standard arm (P = .0023). The third-generation agents (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have been shown to be more effective and safer than the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifen. AIs are well tolerated and cause a lower incidence of gynecological symptoms (vaginal bleeding, discharge, and endometrial neoplasia), venous thromboembolic events, and hot flashes compared with tamoxifen. Mood disturbances, somnolence, anxiety, fatigue, hot flashes, and memory impairment have been reported among patients receiving anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. Twenty-five PM-BC patients received, in sequence, leuprorelin, taxane-anthracycline induction chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a platinum-based intensification high-dose CT, followed by leuprorelin and anastrazole for five years. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed in all patients, no patient showed a decrease of cardiac ejection fraction and hot flashes and arthralgias were of moderate intensity. Of the patients treated with anastrozole, 3 (37.5%) reported toxicity, with 1 report each of decreased libido, leg swelling, and depression (12.5%). Toxicity was reported in 2 patients taking letrozole (40%), with both reporting peripheral edema, and 1 reporting hot flashes. Patients were treated with goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous monthly and began anastrozole 1-mg daily 21 days after the first injection of goserelin. The most common adverse events were fatigue (50%), arthralgias (53%), and hot flashes (59%). These studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIs in the following clinical settings: 1) as initial adjuvant therapy (the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, Breast International Group Trial 1-98), AIs were tolerated well, and patients who received them experienced fewer thrombolic events and less endometrial cancer, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding compared with patients who receive tamoxifen. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). We reviewed therapeutic effects and harmful side effects in 33 patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who underwent treatment with Anastrozole 1 mg/day in our department. The most frequent harmful side effects were rise in total cholesterol, general fatigue, hot flashes and arthralgia (9.1%). We analyzed the changes in frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms in patients receiving tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and identified factors influencing these symptoms. Both first-line tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors induced an increase in the occurrence and severity of hot flashes (p<0.0001 and p=0.014, respectively). To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex), we conducted a phase II trial in 53 women with asymptomatic recurrent/persistent müllerian cancer. Toxicity was modest (grade I) and infrequent, with the most common toxicities being fatigue and hot flashes. The first analysis of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (median follow-up, 33 months) demonstrated that in adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer, anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CLBC). in that endometrial cancer (P = 0.007), vaginal bleeding and discharge (P < 0.001 for both), cerebrovascular events (P < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (P < 0.001), and hot flashes (P < 0.001) all occurred less frequently in the anastrozole group, whereas musculoskeletal disorders and fractures (P < 0.001 for both) continued to occur less frequently in the tamoxifen group. reduced nausea, hot flashes, and abdominal discomfort caused almost twice as many patients to prefer to continue with letrozole therapy than with anastrozole", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III. Primate and rodent genomes are populated with hundreds of thousands copies of Alu and B1 elements dispersed by retroposition, i.e., by genomic reintegration of their reverse transcribed RNAs. Members of this family are readily transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III, but RNA corresponding to only a small sub-set of Alu elements has been found in vivo. Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells. The amplification of genomic Alu elements by retroposition, i.e. by reintegration of reverse-transcribed RNA, suggests that Alu RNA plays an important role in this process. We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements.

RESULTS: Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer. The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model, which had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), and 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays. The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers (IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, SDC1, CCL18, PAI-1, CD44, VEGF, ANG, CA9, A1AT, OPN, PTX3, and APOE) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection : Histopathological grading of papillary urothelial tumors (PUTs) of the urinary bladder is subjective and poorly reproducible. We investigated the relationship between the expression of frequently deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as their target genes (ZEB1/ZEB2) and bladder cancer histopathological grade in an attempt to find a miRNA that might allow more reliable grading of PUTs. The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit. The combination of Mcm5 plus NMP22 improves the detection of UCC and identifies 95% of clinically significant disease. Trials of a commercially developed Mcm5 assay suitable for an end-user laboratory alongside NMP22 are required to assess their potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic and surveillance care pathways. HYAL-1 and HAS1 expression predicted BCa metastasis, and HYAL-1 expression also predicted disease-specific survival. Furthermore, the combined HAS2-HYAL-1 biomarker detected BCa and significantly predicted its recurrence. Cancer biomarkers are the backbone for the implementation of individualized approaches to bladder cancer (BCa).  Through genomic and proteomic profiling of urine, we have identified a panel of biomarkers associated with the presence of BCa. In this study, we evaluated the utility of three of these biomarkers, interleukin 8 (IL-8), Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and Syndecan in the diagnosis of BCa through urinalysis. METHODS: Voided urines from 127 subjects, cancer subjects (n = 64), non-cancer subjects (n = 63) were analyzed. The protein concentrations of IL-8, MMP-9, and Syndecan were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). .

Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. STAT3 plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment and is reported to be a critical mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations. STAT3 activation is mediated through JAK family kinases  EESB treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect multiple intracellular targets Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease. (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis.

{"question": "Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?", "context": "Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) has broad de-SUMOylation activities in vitro, which is essential for embryonic heart development. Silencing SENP2 can reduce myostatin expression and, therefore, promote myogenesis of skeletal muscle. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown. Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells. Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification.

Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis.  We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin. a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis.  Transforming growth factor-beta-independent regulation of myogenesis by SnoN sumoylation. Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation.   In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1. Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Distinct from acetylation defects, sister chromatid cohesion in ctf4Δ and chl1Δ cells is not improved by removing Wapl Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1  Here, we used Xenopus egg extracts to show that AND-1 and Tim1-Tipin, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctf4 and Tof1-Csm3, respectively, are associated with the replisome and are required for proper establishment of the cohesion observed in the M-phase extracts These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks WSS1 was also found to interact genetically with SGS1, TOP3, SRS2 and CTF4, which are involved in recombination, repair of replication forks and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion The catalytic subunit of budding yeast Polalpha (Pol1p) has been shown to associate in vitro with the Spt16p-Pob3p complex, a component of the nucleosome reorganization system required for both replication and transcription, and with a sister chromatid cohesion factor, Ctf4p Constituents of the replication fork, such as the DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein Ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3.

Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. We show here that CTF8, CTF4 and a helicase encoded by CHL1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that Chl1 functions during S-phase. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion.

{"question": "Can FOXOs modulate longevity?", "context": "Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. In contrast to FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO6 were specifically diminished in the CNS of HFD animals possibly contributing to the reduced lifespan observed in these animals. Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses.  Components of anti-ageing and autophagy include SirTs and FoxOs. Since Sirts and FoxOs are reliable markers of longevity, the results appear to suggest that Longevinex induces longevity after prolonged feeding via induction of autophagy, while it converts death signals into survival signals and provides cardioprotection within a relatively shorter period of time. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity In this respect, members of the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs) that include FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 are increasingly being recognized as exciting prospects for multiple disorders. These transcription factors govern development, proliferation, survival and longevity during multiple cellular environments that can involve oxidative stress.  Here we discuss the fascinating but complex role of FoxOs during cellular injury and oxidative stress, progenitor cell development, fertility, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, cellular metabolism and diabetes, cell longevity, immune surveillance and cancer. Many longevity genes, e.g. FoxOs and SIRT1, are inhibitors of NF-kappaB signaling.  Interestingly, several longevity genes such as SIRT1, SIRT6, and FoxOs can clearly suppress NF-kappaB signaling and in this way delay the aging process and extend lifespan. Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival. These observations link FoxO function in mammalian systems with the evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in promotion of stress resistance and longevity in lower phylogenetic systems. Furthermore, these findings have implications for aging in higher organisms and in malignant stem cell biology, and suggest that FoxOs may play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of stem cell compartments in a broad spectrum of tissues. Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are important downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and crucial regulators of cell fate. This function of FoxOs relies on their ability to control diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, defense against oxidative stress and ageing. This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes. In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process. In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO.  In humans, FOXO3a, as well as FOXO1 and -4, and their downstream effectors, could hold the key to counteracting ageing and common diseases.

{"question": "Is Bladder training an effective method to treat  urge incontinence ?", "context": "Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a treatment worthy of further study, as in the short term, it is as effective as historical studies of drug treatment and bladder training in reducing urge incontinence and incontinence-related quality of life. All patients, irrespective of the results of cystometry were subsequently treated with oxybutynin 2.5 mg twice daily along with bladder training. Of the 29 patients with stable bladder and symptoms of OAB, 100% cure rate was achieved in 20 (68.9%) and 06 (20.6%) patients respectively. While in 3 patients in both groups, decrease of symptoms upto 75% after 6 months of treatment was observed. Both urodynamically proven unstable and stable bladder showed nearly equal improvement with treatment There are 3 types of urine incontinence (urge-, stress-, and overflow-incontinence). Another standardization of urinary incontinence follows dysfunctions of the pelvic floor: detrusor muscle-dependent, due to sphincter spasm, prostate gland dependent. Urge incontinence with a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle is the most common type. Mixed types are frequent. Non-drug measures (e.g. pelvic muscle training, bladder training, toilet training are first choice treatments. Treatment of stress, urge and mixed incontinence can usually be commenced in primary care; pelvic floor exercises and bladder training are preferred. If bladder training is not effective for urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs should be considered. Sixty patients (age 8 to 12 years) with urge incontinence or dysfunctional voiding were evaluated. After a no-treatment control period (average 6 months), patients underwent a 6-day bladder training course Six months after training completion, 64.1% and 64.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with daytime wetting and 51.5% and 17.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with nighttime wetting were cured or had improved Of the inpatient group with urge incontinence, the functional bladder capacity increased by 15%. To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen. Bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training) in female urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and bladder training respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by bladder training followed by pelvic floor exercises. T The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times. Some elders suffering from urge incontinence prefer pelvic muscle exercises to bladder training as the behavioral intervention of choice for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both subjectively and objectively. Bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations. It can be used as a first-line treatment or in combination with such other interventions as pelvic muscle exercises, bladder pressure biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and drug therapy Treatment consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence. After 3 months about 60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented. After an average hospitalisation period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the patients. Anamnestic and urodynamical results are evaluated before and after bladder retraining drill (BRD) in women suffering from urge incontinence. We could state that the BRD is a good possibility to realize multistep-therapy of female incontinence. Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind cross-over design. In conclusion, female patients with idiopathic urge incontinence and stable detrusor function did respond to treatment as do female patients with urge incontinence and proven instability. The results of in-patient bladder training in 65 women with frequency, urgency and urge incontinence are reported. There was a good initial response in 88%. By 6 months the response rate had fallen to 38%. Patients with sensory urgency appeared to do better than those with detrusor instability and it is suggested that bladder training may be indicated as primary treatment in sensory urgency. Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence.

{"question": "Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?", "context": "The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pump Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions. SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium. Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling. Sarcolipin (SLN) inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates. The SERCA pump was constitutively activated in both atrial and ventricular chambers of the mouse heart by ablating its key regulators, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). The double-knockout (dKO) mice for PLN and SLN showed increased SERCA pump activity, Ca(2+) transients and SR Ca(2+) load, and developed cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings also emphasize the need for dynamic regulation of the SERCA pump by PLN and/or SLN to maintain cardiac contractility in normal conditions and during pathophysiological states. Sarcolipin (SLN) has emerged as an important regulator of the atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport. The inhibitory effect of SLN on cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump can be relieved by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which indicates that SLN is a reversible inhibitor.  Sarcolipin is a novel regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and is expressed abundantly in atria. Our study documented that sarcolipin is a key regulator of SERCA2a in atria. Importantly, our data demonstrate the existence of distinct modulators for the SERCA pump in the atria and ventricles. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the SR. The activity of SERCA is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), and all these proteins participate in maintaining the normal intracellular calcium handling.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms. The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle. Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation. SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations. We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists. Sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates Ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle. Sarcolipin (SLN) and phospholamban (PLN) are effective inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA).  These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. Sarcolipin (SLN) is an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) in vitro, but its function in vivo has not been defined. NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer. Sarcolipin (SLN), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are expressed. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are two single-pass membrane proteins that regulate Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven pump that translocates calcium ions into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) [Research progress of sarcolipin-a new regulatory protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase].

{"question": "Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?", "context": "We characterized a family presenting with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death without ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities at rest. Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. The mutation was present in the mother and in an sibling, both asymptomatic but displaying a marginally prolonged QT-interval during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptides Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is rivaroxaban metabolized in kidneys?", "context": "The novel oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban) all undergo renal metabolism to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in CKD patients. The new oral anticoagulants have relatively little data in patients with severe renal impairment, and all have an element of renal excretion. Now new anticoagulant drugs(dabigatran and rivaroxaban) can become available. Therefore, we have to learn how to use those drugs. They have to carefully be used because they discharge from kidney and old aged patients have potential renal dysfunction.  In the everyday practice it will be necessary to be very cautious in patients with impaired renal function, as all these drugs are eliminated by kidneys. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. However, all these agents undergo renal clearance to varying degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in patients with CKD.  Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency.

Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Two of these kinases stand out as potential drug targets for novel PD therapy, namely leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylating polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2). Also, due to the dominant mode of α-syn and LRRK2 inheritance and based on current knowledge of LRRK2 and α-syn phosphorylation by PLK2, inhibition of LRRK2 and PLK2 may constitute a potential therapy for PD. To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice. This PLK2-mediated neuroprotective effect is also dependent on PLK2 activity and α-synuclein phosphorylation. PLK2-mediated degradation of α-synuclein requires both phosphorylation at S129 and PLK2/α-synuclein complex formation. Overexpression of only PLK2 increased phosphorylation of aggregated α-syn at S129, which likely is due to increased phosphorylation of soluble α-syn, which then was incorporated into aggregates.

The human genome is composed of large sequence segments with fairly homogeneous GC content, namely isochores Isochores, i.e. stretches of DNA with a distinct sequence composition and thus a specific GC content The human genome is composed of long stretches of DNA with distinct GC contents, called isochores or GC-content domains. The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (>>300 kb) of genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content.  Many eukaryotic genomes contain isochore regions, mosaics of homogeneous GC content that can abruptly change from one neighboring isochore to the next. One of the most striking features of mammalian and birds chromosomes is the variation in the guanine-cytosine (GC) content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to megabases; this is known as the \"isochore\" structure. The segmentation analysis shows that there are stronger indications of GC content changes at isochore borders than within an isochore. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them.

Induction of tubulin acetylation correlated with inhibition of motility but not proliferation based on a comparison of highly and poorly cytotoxic taxanes (paclitaxel and IDN5390) and tumor cell lines sensitive and resistant to paclitaxel (1A9 and 1A9 PTX22). we found that overexpression of the tubulin deacetylase SIRT2 increased cell motility and reduced cell response to the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. Conversely, the SIRT2 inhibitor splitomicin reduced cell motility and potentiated the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. The inhibitory effect was further potentiated by the addition of the HDAC6 inhibitor trichostatin A. Cell motility and adhesion involves dynamic microtubule (MT) acetylation/deacetylation, a process regulated by enzymes as HDAC6, a major cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase. GRK2 and HDAC6 colocalize in the lamellipodia of migrating cells, leading to local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility. This review highlights the emerging roles of tubulin acetylation in multiple cellular functions, ranging from cell motility, cell cycle progression or cell differentiation to intracellular trafficking and signalling. Our results indicate that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. \"tubacin,\" which inhibits alpha-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian cells. We provide evidence that class II histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the intracellular target of tubacin. Tubacin treatment did not affect the stability of microtubules but did decrease cell motility. They also suggest that small molecules that selectively inhibit HDAC6-mediated alpha-tubulin deacetylation, a first example of which is tubacin, might have therapeutic applications as antimetastatic and antiangiogenic agents. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic a-tubulin deacetylase that is involved in cell motility and adhesion. GRK2 dynamically and directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate its a-tubulin deacetylase activity at specific cellular localizations, such as the leading edge of migrating cells, thus promoting local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Can NXY-059 be used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients?", "context": "Even when the international recommendations for preclinical stroke research, the Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria, were followed, we have still seen limited success in the clinic, examples being NXY-059 and haematopoietic growth factors which fulfilled nearly all the STAIR criteria This occurred during 1993-2006, when the 2,4-disulfonylphenyl PBN derivative, called NXY-059 in the stroke studies, was shown to be safe in humans and was taken all the way through clinical phase 3 trials and then was deemed to be ineffective.  The nitrone-based compound NXY-059, which is the first drug to reach clinical trials for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, has provided promise for the development of more robust pharmacological agents.  OKN-007 is a proprietary compound that has had extensive commercial development (designated as NXY-059) for another indication, acute ischemic stroke, and after extensive clinical studies was shown to lack efficacy for this indication but was shown to be very safe for human use.  NXY-059, a polar compound with limited transport across the blood-brain barrier, has demonstrated neuroprotection in several animal models of acute ischemic stroke but failed to confirm clinical benefit in the second phase III trial (SAINT-II). NXY-059 is no longer in development following a lack of efficacy found in a Phase III trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.  We analyzed the quality and adequacy of animal studies supporting the efficacy of NXY-059 and other neuroprotective agents that are currently being investigated in phase II/III trials  In the aftermath of the failed stroke clinical trials with the nitrone spin trap/radical scavenger, NXY-059, a number of articles raised the question: are we doing the right thing?   In 2006, the first positive trial of neuroprotection was published: the SAINT I (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment) study. In February 2008, the SAINT II study was published, indicating that NXY-059 was not effective for AIS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I trial that showed a significant benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY-059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7-category modified Rankin scale (mRS). BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. The continued failure in approving new drugs for treatment of acute stroke has been recently set back by the failure of the NXY-059 (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) II) trial. The SAINT II Trial, a large randomized multicenter clinical trial of the putative neuroprotectant, NXY-059, failed to demonstrate a treatment benefit in acute ischemic stroke.  The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure.  NXY-059, a free radical spin trap agent, was felt by many to have followed these criteria and it was recently shown to improve outcome in AIS patients in the SAINT I trial. However, the repeat, SAINT II trial was a neutral study, the results of which cast doubt on neuroprotection as a viable strategy for AIS.  NXY-059 is a novel free radical-trapping neuroprotectant that reduces infarct size and preserves brain function in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. It is the first neuroprotectant to demonstrate a reduction in global disability in a phase III clinical trial, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability.  CONCLUSIONS: The administration of NXY-059 within six hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved the primary outcome (reduced disability at 90 days), but it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the NIHSS score. Additional research is needed to confirm whether NXY-059 is beneficial in ischemic stroke.

CONCLUSIONS: In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin, compared with placebo, has been associated with improvement in sexual desire, improvement in the number of SSEs, and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire, and is well tolerated. INTRODUCTION: Flibanserin is a mixed 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD).  Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most commonly described form of female sexual dysfunction. There is currently no pharmacological therapy approved to treat HSDD, and therefore, there is an unmet medical need for the development of efficacious treatment alternatives. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S.  Sexual function adverse events across flibanserin groups were generally comparable to placebo.Although these studies were not designed or powered to compare sexual function outcomes, results suggested a potential benefit of flibanserin on sexual function, particularly on female sexual desire, and provided a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of flibanserin as a treatment for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?", "context": "Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac index and does not alter mortality. We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. There is no clear evidence at this point to support thyroid hormone replacement in the latter patients, and it may be potentially harmful. Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended. Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. Thus, there seems to be no sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart procedures.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

In this case report, we used tacrolimus to successfully treat a 13-year-old boy with ocular MG who had suffered from severe steroid complications, including a failure of thrive and osteoporosis.  INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk.  RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0.98 [95 % CI 0.67-1.41]). Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.31-3.14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure. The RANKL/OPG ratio and indices of bone metabolisms are also not affected by THX, although THX increases the levels of IL-7 and RANKL. Both disorders had been controlled for around 15 years by oral prednisolone and a cholinesterase inhibitor following surgical removal of invasive thymoma and radiotherapy, but muscular weakness due to myalgia and an increase in serum levels of myogenic enzymes, mainly ascribable to the recurrence of PM, reappeared immediately after cessation of these drugs, which was done because the patient had multiple bone fractures and severe osteoporosis due to the long-term corticosteroid therapy.  We measured bone density in 36 patients (26 females and 10 males) who had undergone long-term prednisolone administration, and found a decrease in bone density in 31% of female patients and osteoporosis in only 11.5% (three cases). In conclusion, prednisolone-treated patients with myasthenia gravis have an acceptable risk of bone loss if prophylactic medication is administered.

{"question": "Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?", "context": "An East African population that gave rise to non-Africans underwent a selective sweep affecting the subcentromeric region where MTMR8 is located.

As strongly beneficial alleles fix quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. a local selective sweep or demographic process that reduced variability reduced variation (a selective sweep) the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. Our observation of reduction in variation at both intragenic and flanking loci of mutant pfcrt gene confirmed the selective sweep model of natural selection in chloroquine resistant P. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice.

{"question": "Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?", "context": "We and others have published observational epidemiologic studies in support of vitamins in the primary prevention of CVD, but the results from intervention studies are mixed. For vitamin E, observational data suggest benefit at doses of 100 to 400 IU/d. Results from recent large-scale trials are mixed, with some showing modest benefit but others suggesting no benefit, especially for secondary prevention. Results for B vitamins are also mixed and further complicated by the recent folate fortification of the flour supply. If greater B vitamin intake does reduce CVD, the benefits are likely to be greatest for primary prevention and in populations with intake below dietary reference standards.  In the dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible CHD prevention. High levels of α-tocopherol in serum were associated with 30% lower CAD risk in another study (HR 0.71; 95%CI 0.53-0.94). Among minerals (zinc, selenium, and chromium), an inverse association between zinc and CAD was observed; levels lower than 14.1 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk for CAD (RR 1.70; 95%CI 1.21-2.38). The information available on this issue is scarce. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of these nutrients in the cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation at a dosage of 150 mg appears to decrease the inflammatory marker IL-6 in patients with CAD.  Coenzyme Q10 supplements at a dose of 150 mg can decrease oxidative stress and increase antioxidant enzyme activity in patients with CAD. A higher dose of coenzyme Q10 supplements (>150 mg/d) might promote rapid and sustainable antioxidation in patients with CAD. Alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplementation has no protective effect on macrovascular outcomes or total mortality of diabetic male smokers. Sodium selenite supplementation increases GPx-1 activity in endothelial cells and in CAD patients. Future studies have to demonstrate whether long-term CAD outcome can be improved. After 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, a combination pill of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 did not reduce a combined end point of total cardiovascular events among high-risk women, despite significant homocysteine lowering.  In this population-based study, vitamin E use was unrelated to mortality, but this apparently null finding seems to represent a combination of increased mortality in those with severe cardiovascular disease and a possible protective effect in those without.  In this large cohort of apparently healthy US male physicians, self-selected supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, or multivitamins was not associated with a significant decrease in total CVD or CHD mortality.  The American Heart Association has recommended consumption of a balanced diet with emphasis on antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables but has made no recommendations regarding vitamin E supplementation for the general population. Although vitamin E supplementation seems to be safe for most people, recommendations from health care professionals should reflect the uncertainty of established benefit as demonstrated in clinical trials Recent studies show that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C have benefits in CHD prevention; however, supplementation with beta-carotene may have deleterious effects and is not recommended. Current evidence suggests that patients with CHD would probably benefit from taking vitamin E in a dosage of 400 IU per day and vitamin C in a dosage of 500 to 1,000 mg per day. Clinicians may also want to consider vitamin supplementation for CHD prevention in high-risk patients.

{"question": "Is there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?", "context": "Exogenous T3 administration provides neuroprotection in a murine model of traumatic brain injury. Treatment with T3 (1.2μg/100g body weight, i.p.) 1h after TBI resulted in a significant improvement in motor and cognitive recovery after CCI, as well as in marked reduction of lesion volumes.  Western blot analysis revealed the ability of T3 to reduce brain trauma through modulation of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle.  The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential. The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process. Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown. The outcome after brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low triiodothyronine syndrome. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine appear to enhance regeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  T3 treatment influenced the general levels of incorporation of all treated groups over all days postoperation. T3 effects appear to involve an increased sensitivity of the cells of the injured nervous system to the hormone. T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted healing of the wound in the corpus callosum. The results of this investigation suggest that the use of T3 in the clinical treatment of injury to the central nervous system may be of less value than the work of earlier authors had indicated.

{"question": "Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?", "context": "In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. Modification of proteins by the addition of lysine (K)-63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains is suggested to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and receptor endocytosis.  Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling. Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation Activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are modified by homogeneous Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, but only Lys-48-linked chains are required for degradation.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

The lack of specific randomized trials enrolling either old or very old subjects, aimed at evaluate the efficacy of hormonal replacement on overall survival and cardiovascular risk reduction along with the negative effects of possible over-treatment, makes the decision to treat older people a still unresolved clinical challenge In patients with type 2 DM, the presence of SH serves as an additional risk factor for endothelial dysfunction. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. Subclinical hyperthyroidism seems to be a risk factor of developing major cardiovascular events, especially stroke in older adults from the general population with normal left ventricular function. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression. In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, the multiplicity and the possible reversibility of subclinical hypothyroidism-associated cardiovascular abnormalities suggest that the decision to treat a patient should depend on the presence of risk factors, rather than on a TSH threshold.

{"question": "Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?", "context": "Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that occurs in people with a structurally normal heart. Stress or anxiety-induced release of endogenous catecholamines causes a dysfunction in the myocytic calcium-ion channel, leading to ventricular arrhythmias that can cause dizziness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.  During a follow-up of 48±94 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.  We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), leave no evidence to be found at autopsy a spectrum of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-predisposing heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  CPVT is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death Mutations in RyR2 are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and sudden cardiac death. Patients with CPVT often present with exercise- or emotion induced syncope, the first presentation can also be sudden cardiac death. Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural heart disease is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly lethal form of inherited arrhythmias.  Patients with CPVT are at high risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when untreated.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by VT induced by adrenergic stress in the absence of structural heart disease and high incidence of sudden cardiac death.  CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with β-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder that causes syncopal episodes related with stress or emotion and even sudden cardiac deaths. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene manifests as severe arrhythmias, and may provide a candidate for sudden cardiac deaths. Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).  Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.  Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT).  Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. It occurs in patients with structurally normal heart and causes exercise-emotion-triggered syncope and sudden cardiac death. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) Aberrant spontaneous, diastolic Ca2+ leak from the SR due to dysfunctional RyR2 contributes to the formation of delayed after-depolarisations, which are thought to underlie the fatal arrhythmia that occurs in both heart failure (HF) and in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress, characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death in affected patients. families that exhibit CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), a condition in which physical or emotional stress can trigger severe tachyarrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. that often leads to sudden death in HF and in CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disease characterized by adrenergically mediated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia leading to syncope and sudden cardiac death. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and associated with sudden cardiac death.  These data suggest that \"leaky\" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by syncopal events and sudden cardiac death at a young age during physical stress or emotion, in the absence of structural heart disease.   catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts.  has recently been shown to be involved in at least two forms of sudden cardiac death (SCD): (1) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors good candidates to control metastasis of solid tumors?", "context": "JNJ-26481585 also fully inhibited the growth of C170HM2 colorectal liver metastases, whereas again 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin showed modest activity. Although not meeting the RECIST response criteria for adequate single-agent activity, the observed tolerable toxicities and the potential for clinical benefit in terms of stable disease suggest that further assessment of vorinostat as a part of combination therapy with either chemotherapeutic or targeted agents in metastatic breast might be undertaken. Treatments of different structural classes of HDACi simultaneously induced cell death and promoted cell migration and metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. Suppression of HDACi-induced PKCs leads to development of low toxic and long-term therapeutic strategies to potentially treat cancer as a chronic disease. mRNA expression analysis of lung tumor bearing mice suggested that the enhanced chemopreventive activity of the combination is related to atorvastatin modulation of DNA repair, SAHA modulation of angiogenesis, and both drugs modulating invasion and metastasis pathways. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induced morphologic differentiation, cell-cycle exit, and a shift to a differentiated, melanocytic gene expression profile in cultured UM cells. VPA inhibited the growth of UM tumors in vivo. When both drugs were used in concert additive effects were observed on the migratory and invasive behavior but not on tumor-endothelium and tumor-matrix interaction. Separate mTOR or HDAC inhibition slows processes related to tumor metastasis. The RAD001-VPA combination showed advantage over VPA monotreatment with particular respect to migration and invasion. In conclusion, sequential treatments of mice with MS-275 followed by TRAIL may target multiple pathways to reverse EMT and inhibit tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis and represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat cancer. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. We report the first preclinical data for the prevention of brain metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer. Vorinostat is brain permeable and can prevent the formation of brain metastases by 62%. Its mechanism of action involves the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, suggesting rational combinations with DNA active drugs or radiation. Combining vorinostat with radiation may be a potential treatment option for patients with breast cancer who develop brain metastases. Although single-agent PCI-24781 had modest effects on STS growth and metastasis, marked inhibition was observed when combined with chemotherapy. In a 4T1 metastatic breast carcinoma model, AN-7 inhibited the formation of lung lesions by 76% and AN-9 by 47%, further demonstrating the greater efficacy of AN-7 compared to AN-9 (P<0.02). Both AN-7 and AN-9 exhibited antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities by reducing vascularization, bFGF expression and HIF-1alpha. Since prolonged oral administration with 50 mg/kg or a single oral dose of 1.2 g/kg AN-7 did not cause adverse effects and the former exhibited significant anticancer activity, AN-7 is likely to display a high therapeutic index and may be beneficial for prostate cancer patients. We show that apicidin significantly inhibits H-ras-induced invasive phenotype of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells in parallel with a specific downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, but not MMP-9. We also show that apicidin induces a morphological reversal and growth inhibition of H-ras MCF10A cells similar to that induced by other HDAC inhibitors.

{"question": "Is muscle lim protein (MLP) involved in cardiomyopathies?", "context": "Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. In line with this notion, the homozygous loss of MLP results in cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, MLP is induced in several models of cardiac hypertrophy such as aortic banding and myocardial infarction.  Muscle LIM protein (MLP) null mice are often used as a model for human dilated cardiomyopathy. A lack of MLP leads to an age-dependent impairment of excitation-contraction coupling with resulting contractile dysfunction and secondary fibrosis. Loss of murine MLP results in dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in human MLP lead to cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical role for MLP in maintaining normal cardiac function. Our data indicate that MLP contributes to muscle stiffness and is necessary for maximum work and power generation. Interestingly, MLP was also found to be down-regulated in humans with heart failure (Zolk et al. Circulation 101:2674-2677, 2000) and MLP mutations are able to cause hypertrophic and dilated forms of cardiomyopathy in humans (Bos et al. Mol Genet Metab 88:78-85, 2006; Geier et al. Circulation 107:1390-1395, 2003; Hershberger et al. Clin Transl Sci 1:21-26, 2008; Knöll et al. Cell 111:943-955, 2002; Knöll et al. Circ Res 106:695-704, 2010; Mohapatra et al. Mol Genet Metab 80:207-215, 2003). MLP soon became an important model for experimental cardiology when it was first demonstrated that MLP deficiency leads to myocardial hypertrophy followed by a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure phenotype (Arber et al. Cell 88:393-403, 1997).  Previous studies have shown an association between CSRP3 missense mutations and either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM, but all these studies were unable to provide comprehensive genetic evidence for a causative role of CSRP3 mutations.  We used a newly designed monoclonal antibody to show that muscle LIM protein (MLP), the protein encoded by CSRP3, is mainly a cytosolic component of cardiomyocytes and not tightly anchored to sarcomeric structures. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP's mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal protein located at the Z-disc of sarcomeres. Mutations in the human MLP gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Our data demonstrate that Mlp84B is essential for normal cardiac function and establish the Drosophila model for the investigation of the mechanisms connecting defective cardiac Z-disc components to the development of cardiomyopathy. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal LIM-only protein expressed in striated muscle. Mutations in human MLP are associated with cardiomyopathy; TTN-encoded titin, CSRP3-encoded muscle LIM protein, and TCAP-encoded telethonin are Z-disc proteins essential for the structural organization of the cardiac sarcomere and the cardiomyocyte's stretch sensor. All three genes have been established as cardiomyopathy-associated genes for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  Approximately 4.1% of unrelated patients had HCM-associated MLP or TCAP mutations. MLP/TCAP-HCM phenotypically mirrors myofilament-HCM and is more severe than the subset of patients who still remain without a disease-causing mutation. The precise role of W4R-MLP in the pathogenesis of either DCM or HCM warrants further investigation. MLP (muscle-LIM-protein) deficient mice develop DCM and changes in the mechanical coupling of cardiomyocytes result in alterations at the intercalated disks and enhanced accumulation of adherens junction proteins. Targeted deletion of cytoskeletal muscle LIM protein (MLP) in mice consistently leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) after one or more months.  In summary, young MLPKO mice revealed substantial alterations in passive myocardial properties and relaxation time, but not in most systolic characteristics. These results indicate that the progression to heart failure in the MLPKO model may be driven by diastolic myocardial dysfunction and abnormal passive properties rather than systolic dysfunction. Mice lacking the muscle LIM protein (MLP) develop morphological and clinical signs resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Our results show that the absence of MLP causes a local loss of mitochondria. We hypothesize that this is caused by a disturbed interaction between cytoskeleton and mitochondria, which interferes with energy sensing and energy transfer. Recovery of energy depletion by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis might be a useful therapeutic strategy for improving the energy imbalance in heart failure. Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In order to gain an insight into the molecular basis of the disease phenotype, we analysed the binding characteristics of wild-type MLP and of the (C58G) mutant MLP that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R).  MLP-knockout mice develop a marked cardiac hypertrophy reaction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MLP is therefore a candidate gene for heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM in humans. Family studies revealed cosegregation of clinically affected individuals with the respective mutations in MLP. CONCLUSION: Here, we present evidence that mutations in the CRP3/MLP gene can cause HCM. The skeletal muscle LIM protein 1 (SLIM1) is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and its expression is downregulated significantly in dilated human cardiomyopathy.  Targeted disruption of muscle LIM protein (MLP) has previously been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy with many of the clinical signs of heart failure, although the effects of MLP disruption on passive ventricular mechanics and myocyte architecture are not known. These results suggest that the disruption of the cytoskeletal protein MLP results in less compliant passive tissue and concomitant structural alterations in the three-dimensional myocyte architecture that may in part explain the ventricular dysfunction in the dilated heart.  Mutations in cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), the gene encoding MLP, have been directly associated with human cardiomyopathies, whereas aberrant expression patterns are reported in human cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease.

According to pathology, Gliadel did not influence OS of patients with Grade III or glioblastoma CONCLUSION: In patients with high-grade gliomas, adding Gliadel before performing a Stupp protocol did not improve survival. Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.  CONCLUSIONS: The combination of aggressive resection, Gliadel wafer implantation, and GKS in addition to standard fractionated RT in selected patients resulted in increased local control and increased survival compared with a historical control group treated with surgery and involved-field RT alone. OBJECT: Gliadel (BCNU) wafer and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy, when used individually as adjuvant therapies, extend survival from that achieved by resection and radiation therapy (XRT) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  BACKGROUND: Gliadel (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine [BCNU] implant) is commonly used for local delivery of BCNU to high-grade gliomas after resection and is associated with increased survival. Temozolomide administered according to this protocol produced a median survival benefit of 2 months in glioblastomas, and carmustine a similar benefit in high-grade gliomas. Analysis of a large trial by Westphal and colleagues (n = 240) showed a 29% risk reduction (P = 0.03) in the BCNU wafer-treated group over the course of the 30-month trial. Median survival of patients treated with BCNU wafers was 13.8 months vs 11.6 months in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (P = 0.018), representing a 27% significant risk reduction. This survival advantage was maintained at 1, 2, and 3 years and was statistically significant (P = 0.01) at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Malignant glioma patients treated with BCNU wafers at the time of initial surgery in combination with radiation therapy demonstrated a survival advantage at 2 and 3 years follow-up compared with placebo. OBJECTIVE: Recently a randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial of biodegradable polymers containing carmustine has demonstrated a significant survival benefit for patients treated with local chemotherapy.  CONCLUSION: In this subgroup analysis of a phase III trial population both the clinical progression and radiological progression were significantly delayed in patients treated with local chemotherapy, resulting in an increased survival time. A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers. Median survival in the intent-to-treat group was 13.9 months for the BCNU wafer-treated group and 11.6 months for the placebo-treated group (log-rank P -value stratified by country = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death in the treatment group. When adjusted for factors affecting survival, the treatment effect remained positive with a risk reduction of 28% ( P = 0.03).  Controlled release delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers was approved as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme after it was shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated and effective.  Clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in survival and quality of life for patients after complete tumour resection and BCNU wafer implantation. BCNU wafers are an effective means of increasing survival and quality of life in patients diagnosed with malignant glioma, and are a valuable addition to the overall multimodal treatment strategy for these tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Carmustine wafer with concurrent TMZ and radiation followed by rotational chemotherapy is a well tolerated, effective therapy, and has a survival benefit compared with radiation alone. Median overall survival in 14 studies of newly-diagnosed patients suggested a modest improvement versus resection followed by Stupp protocol or resection with BCNU wafers, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. The efficacy of carmustine wafers for older patients with glioblastoma multiforme: prolonging survival. DISCUSSION: Older patients with GBM may benefit from carmustine wafers. The survival for older patients who received carmustine wafers is significantly longer than matched patients who did not receive carmustine wafers. For glioblastoma patients who received ≥90% resection in the BCNU wafer study, median survival increased for BCNU wafer versus placebo (14.5 versus 12.4 months, respectively; P = 0.02), but no survival increase was found for <90% resection (11.7 versus 10.6 months, respectively; P = 0.98). A wafer impregnated with carmustine, for use as an implant after surgical removal of recurrent GBM showed a prolongation in the median survival time of only 2 mo, from 20 to 28 wk in a study with a total of 222 patients.  No clear survival benefit associated with wafer implantation was identified. In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers.  TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials .  The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events.  For patients undergoing repeat resection for malignant glioma, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a median survival for 110 patients who received carmustine polymers of 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for 122 patients who only received placebo polymers. Median survival was improved from 11.6 to 13.9 months (P = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death. When patients with glioblastoma multiforme alone were analyzed, the median survival improved from 11.4 to 13.5 months, but this improvement was not statistically significant.  OBJECT: Locoregional chemotherapy with carmustine wafers, positioned at surgery and followed by radiation therapy, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as has concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events. However, patients with carmustine wafers demonstrated prolonged survival as compared to patients without wafers. The median survival for patients with carmustine wafers was 8.7 months, while median survival for patients without wafers was 5.5 months (P=0.007). Likewise, in subgroup analysis, patients older than 70 years (P=0.0003) and 75 years (P=0.04) who had carmustine wafers had significantly longer survival than matched patients without wafers. Implantation of carmustine wafers did not significantly improve progression-free survival In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer/leukemia susceptibility and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, such as cisplatin. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal recessive syndrome characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and bone marrow failure, which cause aplastic anemia, and an increased incidence of malignancy. Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia (FA) is one of several genetic diseases with characteristic cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents which suggest that FA proteins may function as part of DNA repair processes. Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but how the Fanconi pathway protects cells from DNA crosslinks and whether FA proteins act directly on crosslinks remain unclear.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by bone marrow failure, increased cancer risk and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, implying a role for this pathway in the maintenance of genomic stability. Genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the pathway formed by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins occurs in several cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), rendering the affected tumors potentially hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive human cancer prone syndrome featuring bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents exposure. FA is a chromosome instability syndrome characterized by childhood-onset aplastic anemia, cancer or leukemia susceptibility, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Functional defects in the Fanconi pathway can result in a marked hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C.

{"question": "Is dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?", "context": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). In one study dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.  Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely.   In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects. We conclude that DCP is effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both HypoPP and PSPP. Diclofenamid has now already been administered for 2 years. It is well tolerated and has suppressed further attacks. Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had a moderate but definite effect in the third. Dichlorophenamide should be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide. Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.

Whether these drugs prevent vacuolar myopathy, which is a pathogenic factor in hypoPP, is unknown.  Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP).

{"question": "Is nivolumab used for treatment of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer?", "context": "BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy have limited treatment options. This randomized, open-label, international, phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, as compared with docetaxel in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level. Agents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A). Overall Survival and Long-Term Safety of Nivolumab (Anti-Programmed Death 1 Antibody, BMS-936558, ONO-4538) in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We report overall survival (OS), response durability, and long-term safety in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving nivolumab in this trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 129) with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks in 8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks.  CONCLUSION: Nivolumab monotherapy produced durable responses and encouraging survival rates in patients with heavily pretreated NSCLC. Randomized clinical trials with nivolumab in advanced NSCLC are ongoing. Two PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab and Merck's MK-3475, both demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Sydney, Australia. Recently, many trials addressed the role of such therapies for metastatic NSCLC treatment: ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab and lambrolizumab are immunotherapeutic agents of main interest in this field. Two PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb&apos;s nivolumab and Merck&apos;s MK-3475, both demonstrated positive results in phase I trials of previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer, reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Sydney, Australia Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers Nivolumab versus Docetaxel in Advanced Squamous-Cell Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Activity and safety of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, for patients with advanced, refractory squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (CheckMate 063): a phase 2, single-arm trial.  Patients with squamous non-small-cell lung cancer that is refractory to multiple treatments have poor outcomes. We assessed the activity of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, for patients with advanced, refractory, squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.

{"question": "Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?", "context": "Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. Recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. The mutational profile of the yeast genome is shaped by replication the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands) Late-replicating domains have higher divergence and diversity in Drosophila melanogaster Recent evidence also suggests that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast. Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing. Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3). Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4). A conservative estimate is that at least 1-2% of new deleterious mutations affect some aspect of DNA replication, repair, or chromosome segregation. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have mutation rates that are approximately 0.1 per genome (Drake 1993). This constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates. A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is NOD1 activated in inflammation?", "context": "Nod1 and Nod2 control bacterial infections and inflammation The Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 are two NLR family members that trigger immune defense in response to bacterial peptidoglycan Nod proteins fight off bacterial infections by stimulating proinflammatory signaling and cytokine networks and by inducing antimicrobial effectors, such as nitric oxide and antimicrobial peptides. Nod1 is also critically implicated in shaping adaptive immune responses towards bacterial-derived constituents. Together, Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation. The innate immune receptor Nod1 protects the intestine from inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. we show that Nod1 deficiency results in the increased development of both colitis-associated and Apc tumor suppressor-related colon tumors. In the absence of Nod1 signaling, there is a greater disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier due to chemically induced injury as manifested by increased surface epithelial apoptosis early on during chemically induced colitis and increased intestinal permeability. The increased intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and epithelial cell proliferation in Nod1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Depletion of the gut microbiota suppressed tumor development in Nod1-deficient mice, thus highlighting a link between the commensal bacteria within the intestine and the host innate immune Nod1 signaling pathway in the regulation inflammation-mediated colon cancer development.  NOD1 protein is expressed in the eye and promotes ocular inflammation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.  NOD1 expression in the eye and functional contribution to IL-1beta-dependent ocular inflammation in mice Polymorphisms in NOD1 are associated with autoinflammatory diseases characterized by uveitis such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis NOD1 is homologous to NOD2, which is responsible for an autosomal dominant form of uveitis. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model mice deficient for both Nod1 and Nod2 had attenuated inflammatory pathology, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, and increased colonization of the mucosal tissue The present study has demonstrated an unexpected role of Nod1 in the development of site-specific vascular inflammation, especially coronary arteritis. Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease The present study analyzed Nod1 and Nod2 double deficient (Nod1/2 DKO) mice under physiological and inflammatory conditions Several inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's disease and asthma, are linked to genetic changes in either Nod1 or Nod2. Systematic analysis of Nod1/2 DKO mice revealed a possible role of Nod1/2 in the development of renal disease during systemic inflammation. NOD1 and NOD2 Signaling in Infection and Inflammation NOD1 engagement generates an inflammatory response via activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways.  In addition we profile novel inhibitors of RIP2 and NOD1 itself, which specifically inhibit NOD1 ligand induced inflammatory signalling in the vasculature.  This data supports the potential utility of NOD1 and RIP2 as therapeutic targets in human disease where vascular inflammation is a clinical feature, such as in sepsis and septic shock. NOD1 expression elicited by iE-DAP in first trimester human trophoblast cells and its potential role in infection-associated inflammation This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NOD1 in first trimester trophoblast cells, and evaluate the potential role of trophoblast cells in infection-associated inflammation NOD1 may have a role in mediating infection-associated inflammation. Once iE-DAP is recognized by NOD1, the inflammatory response may be induced via NOD1-RICK-NF-κB-mediated pathways. NOD1/2(-/-) mice were protected from HFD-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and peripheral insulin intolerance. In contrast, Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage, consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation, and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model. Whereas the lymphotoxin pathway was critical for the induction of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in response to Nod1 agonists, B cell accumulation within the spleen following Nod1-induced systemic inflammation was independent of the lymphotoxin pathway. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. A key role for the endothelium in NOD1 mediated vascular inflammation: comparison to TLR4 responses. We previously demonstrated that human first-trimester trophoblasts express Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger inflammation upon stimulation. In addition, recent studies have revealed a role for intracellular NOD1 receptors in the regulation of vascular inflammation and metabolism. In conclusion, the present findings describe an important role for NOD1 in the development of insulin resistance and inflammation in pregnancies complicated by GDM. Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease. Nod1 activation by bacterial iE-DAP induces maternal-fetal inflammation and preterm labor. The nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognise a wide range of microbial products, as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB).  Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance.  Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model. In particular, muramyl peptides trigger inflammation, contribute to host defense against microbial infections, and modulate the adaptive immune response to antigens.  Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in NOD ligand-injected mice.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance. Acute activation of NOD proteins by mimetics of bacterial PGNs causes whole-body insulin resistance, bolstering the concept that innate immune responses to distinctive bacterial cues directly lead to insulin resistance.  Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells. These studies suggest that the Th1 cytokine, IFN gamma, activates CARD4/NOD1 transcription and regulate innate immune mechanisms in the condition of intestinal mucosal inflammation. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, In contrast to enhanced leptin mRNA by LPS and TNFα, NOD1 activation suppressed leptin mRNA in adipocytes, suggesting the differential effects of NOD1 activation in adipocytes.  Overall, our results suggest that NOD1 represents a novel target for adipose inflammation in obesity. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, antimicrobial mechanisms and autophagy in both epithelial cells and murine macrophages. NOD1 is an intracellular immune receptor that senses peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria and responds by inducing autophagy and activating NF-κB, leading to inflammation-mediated bacterial clearance; however chronic pathogens can evade NOD1-mediated clearance by altering peptidoglycan structure. Bacterial NOD1 activation is positioned as a component of metabolic endotoxemia that can contribute to hyperlipidemia, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by acting directly on adipocytes. NOD1 ligand also caused inflammation and insulin resistance directly in primary hepatocytes from WT, but not NOD1(-/-), mice. We conclude that NOD1 activation reduced AHR in allergen-induced lung inflammation, which was accompanied by a reduction of allergen-specific T-cell proliferation. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed.

{"question": "Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?", "context": "CONCLUSION: Patients assigned a higher serum magnesium concentration had a reduced incidence of vasospasm as seen by angiography, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups. 158 patients (26·2%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25·3%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1·03, 95% CI 0·85-1·25). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·86-1·08). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.  Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial. tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome. Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0.292, odds ratio 1.750, 95% CI 0.616-4.974. Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1.598, 95% CI 1.074-2.377, statistically significant.  RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes. On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes. The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively.  CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.  The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.  On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083).   CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.  There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328). A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture. There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.  Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.  CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome. CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay. None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.  We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.  Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved. CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a significant change in MAP and ICP. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit Despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

{"question": "Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?", "context": "The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex structure that carries out a diverse range of functions such as DNA replication, cell division, RNA processing, and nuclear export/import. Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. There may be certain efficiency benefits to cluster transcriptional activity in this way. However, the clustering of genes at transcription factories may have consequences for genome stability, and increase the susceptibility to recurrent chromosomal translocations that lead to cancer In the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factories Based on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific, co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear space active polymerases cluster into replication and transcription \"factories\" in both pro- and eukaryotes. We conclude that the second law of thermodynamics acts through nonspecific entropic forces between engaged polymerases to drive the self-organization of genomes into loops containing several thousands (and sometimes millions) of basepairs Since the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase nuclei.

{"question": "Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?", "context": "The selenoprotein-deficient mice exhibited accelerated development of lesions associated with prostate cancer progression, implicating selenoproteins in cancer risk and development and raising the possibility that selenium prevents cancer by modulating the levels of these selenoproteins Notably and in contrast to previous studies, RWPE-1 cells were significantly more sensitive to selenite than either of the prostate cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies. This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype. We conclude that decreased SEPP concentration in serum might represent an additional valuable marker for prostate cancer diagnostics. The recently completed Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was one of the largest human cancer prevention trials ever undertaken. Its purpose was to assess the role of selenium and vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention, but SELECT found no decline in prostate cancer.

{"question": "Has protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?", "context": ": Citrullination has become a hot topic within recent years due to its involvement in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis and fibrosis.  Current literature suggests that increased levels of citrullinated proteins are found in several if not all inflammatory diseases.  Antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins and peptides (ACPAs) are the most specific serological markers available for diagnosing RA.  Citrullination of proteins is well described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and hypercitrullination of proteins may be related to inflammation in general.  Some ACPA are remarkably effective as diagnostics in autoimmune disorders, most notably rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several ACPA can be observed before other clinical RA manifestations are apparent.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide autoantibodies (ACPAs).  Anti-citrullinated peptides as autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis-relevance to treatment. The implications of citrullination affecting integrin binding in disease open up a new area of study and might have implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. In this paper, we will review the three of the main classes of PTMs already associated with RA: citrullination, carbamylation, and oxidation. Citrullinated collagen II (CII) is a well-known autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Among the RA-associated autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively in the last decade.

{"question": "Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?", "context": "Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI. We propose that the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery. The precursor primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B., and Clayton, D. A. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 3135-3143). We found that overproduction of RecG protein drastically decreased copy numbers of ColE1-type plasmids, which require R-loop formation between the template DNA and a primer RNA transcript (RNA II) for the initiation of replication. These results suggest that overproduced RecG inhibits the initiation of replication by prematurely resolving the R-loops formed at the replication origin region of these plasmids with its unique helicase activity. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed Furthermore, increased RNaseH expression significantly alleviated genomic instability in deficient fibroblasts suggesting that cotranscriptional R-loops formation contributes to the genesis of replication-dependent DSBs in these cells. Transcription is an important source of replicative stress and consequently, maintenance of genome integrity requires the protection of chromosomes from the deleterious effects arising from the interaction between nascent RNAs and template DNA, leading to stable DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loop) formation. Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E. coli and HeLa cells. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stabilit R-loop-mediated genomic instability is caused by impairment of replication fork progression When any of these processes are not properly coordinated, aberrant outcomes such as fork reversal and R-loop formation arise and trigger unscheduled recombinogenic events and genome rearrangements.  Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and homologous recombination can be regulated. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.  In agreement with this, we found that R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins, precisely at the position displaying the highest density of G4 motifs.  connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability. R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? Stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) prime the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli cells. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. Immediately after infection, RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) occur on (at least some) replication origins, with the annealed RNA serving as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in one direction. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. This scenario builds on the connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers. Mechanisms of primer RNA synthesis and D-loop/R-loop-dependent DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. Our results suggest that Top1 execute this function by suppressing the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids during transcription, these so-called R-loops interfering with the progression of replication forks. Critical role of R-loops in processing replication blocks. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. Competition between the RNA transcript and the nontemplate DNA strand during R-loop formation in vitro: a nick can serve as a strong R-loop initiation site. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stability.  Consistent with this hypothesis, the 3' ends of the mitochondrial R-loop formed by in vitro transcription are located close to the initiation sites of the mitochondrial DNA replication.  A hybrid G-quadruplex structure formed between RNA and DNA explains the extraordinary stability of the mitochondrial R-loop. Previous studies have shown that the newly synthesized primers form a stable and persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, a R-loop, near the leading-strand origin of DNA replication.  Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Are CTCF and BORIS involved in genome regulation and cancer?", "context": "CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation  The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role. Indeed, the ability of CTCF to bind their promoters strictly depends by cell-type features as DNA methylation, BORIS-binding and post-translational modifications as PARYlation Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related associations between haploinsufficiency of CTCF and BORIS derepression, and between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of BORIS CTCF and BORIS in genome regulation and cancer. The novel BORIS + CTCF gene family is uniquely involved in the epigenetics of normal biology and cancer. Collectively, these data indicate that reciprocal binding of CTCF and BORIS to the NY-ESO-1 promoter mediates epigenetic regulation of this CT gene in lung cancer cells, and suggest that induction of BORIS may be a novel strategy to augment immunogenicity of pulmonary carcinomas. BORIS is the only known paralog of CTCF, a gene intimately involved in genomic imprinting, chromatin insulation, and nuclear regulation. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation. We suggest that BORIS is likely tethering epigenetic machinery to a novel class of CTCF/BORIS 11ZF target sequences that mediate induction of cancer-testis genes.

Stem cell populations are rapidly increasing, and we are still in the search of optimal cell types to use in clinical trials as bone marrow stem cells did not show significant improvement in cardiac function following transplantation. Several clinical trials using adult stem cell have shown improvements in cardiac function, however, the mechanism of their action is unclear and widespread tissue regeneration is not evident. As we await results from larger and more prolonged clinical trials, the science of stem cell therapy in cardiac disease keeps progressing. Stem cell therapy for treatment of cardiac disease has shown therapeutic potential. It should be noted that stem cell therapy is not limited to the treatment of ischemic cardiac disease. Over the past 2 decades, there have been numerous stem cell studies focused on cardiac diseases, ranging from proof-of-concept to phase 2 trials. This series of papers focuses on the legacy of these studies and the outlook for future treatment of cardiac diseases with stem cell therapies. Cell transplantation to repair or regenerate injured myocardium is a new frontier in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Current therapies only delay progression of the cardiac disease or replace the diseased heart with cardiac transplantation. Stem cells represent a recently discovered novel approach to the treatment of cardiac failure that may facilitate the replacement of diseased cardiac tissue and subsequently lead to improved cardiac function and cardiac regeneration.

It should be noted that stem cell therapy is not limited to the treatment of ischemic cardiac disease. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and aging may be treated by stem cells.  Recent clinical trials have achieved favorable initial endpoints with improvements in cardiac function and clinical symptoms following cellular therapy. we consider how cardiac stem cell biology has led us into clinical trials, and we suggest that achieving true cardiac regeneration in patients may ultimately require resolution of critical controversies in experimental cardiac regeneration. Cell-based therapies and tissue engineering provide new promising platforms to develop upcoming therapeutic options. Initial clinical trials were able to generate promising results. A variety of different stem cell types have been used for the clinical application.   Insights gained from clinical trials of adult stem cells, together with fundamental scientific advances in cardiac stem cell and regenerative biology, are beginning to yield potential new targets and strategies for regenerative therapies.  Early animal trials have demonstrated the ability to improve cardiac function by transfer of HSCs into the myocardium, and early human studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this approach.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?", "context": "DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA involved in the regulation of gene expression by controlling the access to the DNA sequence.  Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation play important biological roles in gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation during development. DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments. DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.  Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation alter gene expression at the level of transcription by upregulating, downregulating, or silencing genes completely. Dysregulation of epigenetic events can be pathological, leading to cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer development. DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. Epigenetic control, which includes DNA methylation and histone modifications, leads to chromatin remodeling and regulated gene expression. Epigenetic modifications on the DNA sequence (DNA methylation) or on chromatin-associated proteins (i.e., histones) comprise the \"cellular epigenome\"; together these modifications play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetics is a process involved in gene regulation, mediated via DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and functional noncoding RNAs, which influences the accessibility of the underlying DNA to transcriptional regulatory factors that activate or repress expression. Significant progress has been made in the basic understanding of how various epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNA expression, and higher order chromatin structure affect gene expression.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines We localized several conserved non-coding elements containing multiple erythroid specific transcription factor binding sites at the GFI1B locus. In GFI1B-expressing cells a subset of these conserved non-coding elements and the promoter adopt a close spatial conformation, localize with open chromatin sites, harbor chromatin modifications associated with gene activation and bind multiple transcription factors and co-repressors Our findings indicate that GFI1B regulatory elements behave as activators and repressors To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B), a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages Our data indicate that Gfi-1B signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b are homologous transcriptional repressors involved in diverse developmental contexts, including hematopoiesis and oncogenesis Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1 We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis Gfi1 and Gfi1b act equivalently in haematopoiesis our findings show that an intact SNAG domain is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1 functionally in haematopoiesis Gfi-1 oncoproteins in hematopoiesis Recent gene targeting experiments and mutational screening in humans have revealed an essential role for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis Gfi-1B disruption is embryonic lethal due to a block of erythropoiesis.

Gfi-1b(-/-) embryos exhibit delayed maturation of primitive erythrocytes and subsequently die with failure to produce definitive enucleated erythrocytes Gfi-1b is an essential transcriptional regulator of erythroid and megakaryocyte development Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Conversely, loss of gfi1b silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis.

{"question": "Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?", "context": "While detailed histological subtyping remains the best independent predictor of aggressive behavior in the majority of cases, evidence suggests that the additional analyses of FGFR4, MMP, PTTG, Ki-67, p53, and deletions in chromosome 11 may contribute to decisions concerning management of aggressive pituitary adenomas. We observed elevation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and consequent 3-D cell invasion in cells under-expressing RECK.   Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats.  Inhibition of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor growth and angiogenesis in Fischer 344 rats by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  We found no correlation of MMP-9 expression and tumour invasion. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes. CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that are able to degrade the extracellular matrix and allow angiogenesis and tumor invasion.  MMP-9 expression did not differ between noninvasive tumors and normal pituitary gland, or between different sized prolactinomas. MMP-9 expression was related to aggressive tumor behavior. It was higher in invasive macroprolactinomas (P = 0.003) when compared with noninvasive macroprolactinomas or the normal anterior pituitary gland. In addition, although there was no difference in whether MMP-9 was present or not when nonfunctioning adenomas that recurred were compared with those that did not, samples of recurrent tumor at the second presentation were more likely to express MMP-9 (P = 0.01). Pituitary carcinomas were significantly more likely to be MMP-9 positive compared with normal anterior pituitary gland (P = 0.05), but there was no difference from invasive adenomas. Angiogenesis assessed by vascular density was related to MMP-9 expression (P<0.05). In summary, we have shown the presence of MMP-9 expression in some invasive and recurrent pituitary adenomas, and in the majority of pituitary carcinoma. The mechanisms whereby MMP-9 expression influences tumor recurrence and invasiveness, and its association with angiogenesis, remains to be elucidated.  Beside the digestion of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis, more recently, new functions for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been proposed.  CONCLUSION: No correlation could be established between the invasive potential of tumors and MMP-1, -2, and -3 expression levels.  Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas.

Accumulating evidence links vitamin D deficiency with abnormal glucose metabolism, and epidemiological studies have shown that women who develop GDM are more likely to be vitamin D deficient This review discusses the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of GDM and vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women, outlines the possible mechanism of action of vitamin D in glucose homeostasis, and summarizes emerging evidence that associates vitamin D deficiency with the risk of developing GDM Women with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level less than 50 nmol/l in pregnancy experienced an increased risk of preeclampsia [OR 2.09 (95%CI 1.50 -2.90)], gestational diabetes mellitus [OR1.38 (1.12-1.70)] Low maternal vitamin D levels in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, Association between vitamin D insufficiency and the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant Chinese women 25OHD insufficiency is very common in Chinese women. Low 25OHD status may be associated with insulin resistance and act as a risk factor for GDM. Second-trimester 25(OH)D levels were associated inversely with glucose levels after 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test; low 25(OH)D levels may be associated with increased risk of GDM. Two hundred sixty-six women were screened. Vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D <20 ng/mL) was observed in 157 women (59%). We observed an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D levels and hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, serum insulin, and fasting and 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose levels Lower 25(OH)D levels are associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and adverse obstetric and newborn outcomes. An association between mid-gestational 25-hydroxy vitamin D and fasting glucose was confirmed in a largely normoglycaemic and vitamin D-replete pregnant population. The correlation between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and β-cell function suggests that vitamin D may influence glucose metabolism through this mechanism. Women with gestational diabetes had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with control subjects (56.3 vs. 62.0 nmol/l, P = 0.018). After adjusting for gestational age and maternal weight, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D below the top quartile (< 73.5 nmol/l) was associated with a twofold greater likelihood of gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.19-4.13). CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin D status in early pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent gestational diabetes that was independent of race, age, season and maternal weight. This study suggests that vitamin D may influence glucose tolerance during pregnancy Vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is frequent in many populations over the world. It is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and caesarean section Consequences in newborns are low birth weight, neonatal rickets, a risk of neonatal hypocalcemia, asthma and/or type 1 diabetes. A single injection of 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 achieves a 3-month serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D range of 50-80 nmol/l and is an efficient, effective and safe procedure for improving the vitamin status and indices of insulin resistance in mothers with gestational diabetes after delivery. In a cohort of pregnant women with mostly sufficient levels of serum 25(OH)D, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with GDM. The aim of the study is evaluating the associations of FokI vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and its relations with postpartum metabolic syndrome. Our results indicate a meaningful association between FokI VDR genotypes and an increase risk of GDM in Iranian population as well as its effects on postpartum metabolic syndrome. The first-trimester maternal serum level of 25(OH)D is not altered in women with type 2 diabetes, those who develop GDM or those who deliver LGA neonates. Lower 25(OH)D levels are independently associated with poorer glycaemic control. Future randomised trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D plays a role in glycaemic control in GDM. These results suggested that rates of vitamin D deficiency are higher among women with IGT/GDM, and the relationship between vitamin D status and glucose tolerance in pregnancy needs further study. It appears that vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is potentially associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, insulin resistance and gestational diabetes mellitus Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 53.8 +/- 23.9 nmol/l (sd). Ln-25OHD was negatively correlated with serum parathyroid hormone as expected (r -0.24, confidence intervals -0.35 to -0.12). Ln-25OHD was also negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r-0.20, -0.31 to -0.08), fasting insulin (r -0.20, -0.31 to -0.08) and insulin resistance as calculated by homeostasis model assessment (r -0.21, -0.32 to -0.09). The association between fasting glucose and log-transformed 25OHD concentration was of borderline significance after accounting for ethnicity, age and body mass index in multivariate analyses (-0.13, -0.26 to 0.01). The odds ratio of gestational diabetes in women with 25OHD < 50 nmol/l did not reach statistical significance (1.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89-4.17). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 25OHD concentrations are inversely related to fasting glucose, although further studies are required to establish whether this is independent of the effects of ethnic background. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in Indian mothers but is not associated with gestational diabetes or variation in newborn size. There was no association between maternal 25(OH)D and gestational diabetes (incidence 7% in women with and without hypovitaminosis D) In mothers with hypovitaminosis D, higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with lower 30-min glucose concentrations (P=0.03) and higher fasting proinsulin concentrations (P=0.04) Hypovitaminosis D at 30 weeks gestation is common in Mysore mothers. It is not associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, Total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was found in 70.6% of pregnant women. Prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency (<12.5) in GDM patients was higher than in normoglycaemic pregnancies. These results show that a positive correlation of 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations with insulin sensitivity and vitamin D deficiency could be a confirmative sign of insulin resistance. was to examine whether maternal dietary intake of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids during pregnancy is associated with the appearance of islet autoimmunity (IA) in offspring Maternal intake of vitamin D via food was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA appearance in offspring, independent of HLA genotype, family history of type 1 diabetes, presence of gestational diabetes mellitus, and ethnicity (adjusted HR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.78). Vitamin D intake via supplements, omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids intake during pregnancy were not associated with appearance of IA in offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maternal intake of vitamin D through food during pregnancy may have a protective effect on the appearance of IA in offspring.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

The proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of mock control data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results. Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data  This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq) The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is clathrin involved in E-cadherin endocytosis?", "context": "We demonstrated that GnT-III induced a stabilizing effect on E-cadherin at the cell membrane by inducing a delay in the turnover rate of the protein, contributing for the formation of stable and functional adherens-junctions, and further preventing clathrin-dependent E-cadherin endocytosis. Conversely, GnT-V promotes the destabilization of E-cadherin, leading to its mislocalization and unstable adherens-junctions with impairment of cell-cell adhesion. Here we show that E-cadherin polarity is controlled by the polarized regulation of clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis. We delineate a pathway that controls the initiation of E-cadherin endocytosis through the regulation of AP2 and clathrin coat recruitment by E-cadherin. Clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin is regulated by the Arf6GAP isoform SMAP1 E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junction in epithelial cells and continuously undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolae depending on the cell type. Collectively, SMAP1 likely represents a key Arf6GAP in clathrin dependent endocytosis of E-cadherin in MDCK cells. Consistent with these observations, we found that selective uncoupling of p120 from E-cadherin by introduction of amino acid substitutions in the p120-binding site increased the level of E-cadherin endocytosis. The increased endocytosis was clathrin-dependent, because it was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin or by hypertonic shock. We found that in this experimental system E-cadherin entered a transferrin-negative compartment before transport to the early endosomal compartment, where it merged with classical clathrin-mediated uptake pathways.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?", "context": "Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally) The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs.  The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II s a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA.  We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation. Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation Abundant evidence indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are tethered to RNAP II for splicing. Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional coordination Co-transcriptional splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: considerations for the mechanism of alternative splicing The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?", "context": "In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 \"Panoramix,\" and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA silencing. In different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is still far from being understood Analyses of piRNA-mediated transcriptional transposon silencing in Drosophila Transcriptional silencing implies a piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the transcriptional capacity of the target locus. In mice, piRNA-guided transposon repression correlates with establishment of CpG DNA methylation on their sequences, yet the mechanism and the spectrum of genomic targets of piRNA silencing are unknown Using a candidate gene KD-approach, we identified differences in the spatio-temporal requirements of the piRNA pathway components for piRNA-mediated silencing. Spatio-temporal requirements for transposable element piRNA-mediated silencing during Drosophila oogenesis In contrast, piRNA-mediated silencing is strong in germline stem cells in which TE mobilization is tightly repressed ensuring the continued production of viable germline cysts. Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons.  Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense. Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing small-RNA-mediated silencing. A novel organelle, the piNG-body, in the nuage of Drosophila male germ cells is associated with piRNA-mediated gene silencing. Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome.

We report a proof-of-mechanism study of RG7112, a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist, in patients with chemotherapy-naive primary or relapsed well-differentiated or dedifferentiated MDM2-amplified liposarcoma who were eligible for resection. To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Discovery of RG7112: A Small-Molecule MDM2 Inhibitor in Clinical Development. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis).  RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

{"question": "Are there any specific antidotes for dabigatran?", "context": "Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs.  However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect. Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications; Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilat (Pradaxa®), rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®), also known as \"direct\" anticoagulants, act independently from antithrombin by inhibiting thrombin, as in the case of dabigatran, or by inhibiting factor Xa, as in the case of rivaroxaban and apixaban. It is assumed that they are suitable for long-term use and do not require laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, clinical experience is very limited and caution rather than quick conclusions is necessary. Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes.  NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication.  It is critical to identify and subsequently manage dabigatran etexilate toxicity because there is no specific antidote to reverse the drug's anticoagulant effects. In the absence of a specific antidote for this novel oral anticoagulant medication, even in an emergency situation, successful surgical treatment was possible with an aggressive use of available prohaemostatic agents. While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in \"real-life\" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  As there is no specific antidote, the only treatment option is discontinuation of the drug and supportive management. Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Although there is no specific antidote to antagonise the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, due to its short duration of effect drug discontinuation is usually sufficient to reverse any excessive anticoagulant activity.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

{"question": "Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?", "context": "The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling. Thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) is shown to be critical for the maturation of cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. TRα1 is altered during post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this response is not fully understood.  AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TRα1 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function. These findings reveal crucial roles for Dio3 in heart function and remodeling, which may have pathophysiologic implications for human restrictive cardiomyopathy. TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. We conclude that diabetes exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and that tissue hypothyroidism may be involved in this response. Thyroid hormone can favorably remodel the diabetic myocardium after acute myocardial infarction. It has been previously shown that regulators of physiological growth such as thyroid hormone (TH) can favorably remodel the post ischaemic myocardium. Acute myocardial infarction in diabetic rats results in TH receptor down-regulation with important physiological consequences. TH treatment prevents this response and improves cardiac hemodynamics. TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular remodeling. Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling.  TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure. Changes in thyroid hormone (TH)-TH receptors (TRs) axis occur in the course of post-infarction cardiac remodeling and seem to contribute to cardiac fetal phenotype. TH can \"rebuild\" the post-infarcted heart by preventing the fetal-like pattern of contractile proteins expression, normalizing wall tension, and optimizing cardiac chamber geometry.  TH, apart from its \"classical\" actions on cardiac contractility and heart rhythm, appears to regulate various intracellular signaling pathways related to stress responses and cardiac remodelling. More importantly, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that TH can limit ischaemic injury, attenuate cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac hemodynamics.  Thyroid hormone attenuates cardiac remodeling and improves hemodynamics early after acute myocardial infarction in rats. Thyroid hormone administration early after infarction attenuates cardiac remodeling and significantly improves myocardial performance. It has previously been shown that thyroid hormone can reverse cardiac remodeling in failing hearts by reducing myocardial wall stress due to the unique changes induced in cardiac myocyte shape.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is miR-21 related to carcinogenesis?", "context": "miR-21* and miR-203 were significantly dysregulated (P < 0.05) in PTC tissues with BRAFV600E. Expressions of miRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma and their associations with the BRAFV600E mutation. Levels of miRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-106a in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher compared with the levels in adjacent tissues (P = .006 and P = .001, respectively). Patients who had gastric cancer had significantly different levels of gastric juice miR-21 and miR-106a compared with patients who had benign gastric diseases (both P < .001). miR-21 levels in intestinal type gastric cancer specimens were higher than that in diffuse (P = .003) or mixed (P < .001) gastric cancer types. MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly over-expressed in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC, but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared to non-IBD controls (p<0.001). Importantly, in patients with IBD-CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 over-expression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (p<0.001). Here we hypothesize that over-expression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related miRNAs that target core MMR proteins, may constitute a pre-neoplastic event for the development of MSI IBD-CRCs. After administration, we determined the expressions of miR-21, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-93, miR-143, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-155, miR-196a, miR-203, miR-205, miR-221 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells-1 (Nfκb1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-8 (Mapk8) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) genes in the liver of mice. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is controlled by miR-21. Consistently with PDCD4 downregulation, miR-21 was upregulated in neoplastic by comparison with nonneoplastic tissue samples. Expression of miR-21 (p=0.027), miR-181b (p=0.002), and miR-146b (p=0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p=0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with patients' overall survival. We analyzed the expression of nine miRNAs (miR-21, miR-127, miR-154, miR-224, miR-323, miR-370, miR-9*, miR-183, and miR-375) by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction in 34 cases of sMTC, 6 cases of hMTC, and 2 cases of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH). MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323, 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183, and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). The most frequent changes in miRNAs in CLL cells included downregulation of miR-126, miR-572, miR-494, miR-923, miR-638, miR-130a, miR-181a and miR-181b and up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-660, miR-20a, miR-106b, miR-142-5p, miR-101, miR-30b, miR-34a, miR-let-7f, miR-21 and miR-155. Results: MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323 and 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183 and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). We found that the onco-miRNAs miR-21 and miR-221 displayed upregulated expression while the liver-specific miR-122 was downregulated. The aim of the present review was to describe the mechanisms of several known miR, summarize recent studies on oncogenic miR (e.g. miR-21, miR-106a and miR-17), tumor suppressor miR (e.g. miR-101, miR-181, miR-449, miR-486, let-7a) and controversial roles of miR (e.g. miR-107, miR-126) for gastric cancer. MiR-15b and miR-21 were differentially expressed in CSF samples from patients with gliomas, compared to control subjects with various neurologic disorders, including patients with primary CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous brain metastases. Moreover, inclusion of miR-15b and miR-21 in combined expression analyses resulted in an increased diagnostic accuracy with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity to distinguish patients with glioma from control subjects and patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Many aberrantly expressed miRNAs were related to various cancers (e.g., miR-125b, hepatocellular carcinoma; miR-21, leukemia; miR-16, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; miR-192, pituitary adenomas; miR-199a-3p, ovarian cancer; miR-34a, pancreatic cancer). Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. In addition, diet and carcinogen exposure modulated a number of microRNAs (miR-16, miR-19b, miR-21, miR26b, miR27b, miR-93, and miR-203) linked to canonical oncogenic signaling pathways. RESULTS: Elevated miR-21 (HR 2.06, 1.13-3.75), miR-17 (HR 2.00, 1.10-3.61), and miR-155 (HR 2.37, 1.27-4.42) was associated with worse cancer-specific mortality in the Maryland cohort. NF-κB targets miR-16 and miR-21 in gastric cancer: involvement of prostaglandin E receptors. Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. hese two miRNAs have previously been identified as being overexpressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with miR-21 specifically implicated in down-regulating the tumor suppressor gene, tropomyosin-1. MicroRNA-21 is involved in ionizing radiation-promoted liver carcinogenesis. We showed here that among several hundred miRNAs, miR-21 was the only one that increased 6 folds in high-LET IR-promoted mouse liver tumors when compared with that in the non-irradiated liver tissues. We also showed that miR-21 was up-regulated in human or mouse hepatocytes after exposure to IR, as well as in liver tissues derived from whole body irradiated mice. After the non-irradiated, low-LET or high-LET irradiated human hepatocytes were over-expressed with miR-21, these cells became tumorigenesis in nude mice. METHODS: We used this combined ISH/IHC assay to study a subset of cancer-associated miRNAs, including miRNAs frequently detected at low (miR-34a and miR-126) and high (miR-21 and miR-155) levels, in a panel of breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and prostate carcinomas. The miR-15a, miR-16, miR-143, miR-155, and miR-21 were upregulated in M059K, and the modulation of these miRNAs fluctuated in M059J cells in a time-dependent manner. Aberrantly increased expression of miR-21 plays a significant role in lung carcinogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target in both epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant and wild-type cases. Additionally, high miR-21 expression was associated with significantly decreased 5 year survival in patients (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.77) in a model controlled for patient age, gender and tumor stage. ESULTS: In adenocarcinoma patients, miR-21, miR-223, miR-192, and miR-194 expression was elevated, whereas miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. Significantly, elevated miR-21 expression in noncancerous tissue of SCC patients and reduced levels of miR-375 in cancerous tissue of adenocarcinoma patients with Barrett's were strongly associated with worse prognosis. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. In mice treated with VC and given I3C in the diet, levels of miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were reduced relative to the level in mice treated with the carcinogen only. Further studies with miR-21 indicated that phosphatase and tensin homolog, programmed cell death 4 and rich protein with Kazal motifs are potential targets for the oncogenic effect of miR-21 and the chemopreventive activity of I3C. This study examines the potential clinical utility of an inflammatory gene expression signature as a prognostic biomarker for colon cancer in addition to previously examined miR-21 expression. CONCLUSIONS: IRS and miR-21 expression are independent predictors of colon cancer prognosis and may provide a clinically useful tool to identify high-risk patients. The most highly expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer tissues were miR-20b, miR-20a, miR-17, miR-106a, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-106b, miR-18b, miR-421, miR-340*, miR-19a and miR-658. Recent findings report their involvement in hair follicle morphogenesis (ablation of miRNAs from keratinocytes causes several defects, such as evagination instead of invagination), in psoriasis (skin-specific expression of miR-203 and psoriasisspecific expression of miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b in the skin), in autoimmune diseases affecting the skin, such as SLE and ITP, in wound healing (changes in the expression of specific miRNA at specific phases of the regeneration process), and in skin carcinogenesis (a novel miRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic miRNA). RESULTS: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients. Selected for validation were miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, and miR-203, and all 5 were enriched in tumors from the validation cohort (P < .001). Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) and in tumors with more advanced TNM staging (P < .001). In situ hybridization demonstrated miR-21 to be expressed at high levels in colonic carcinoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. Changing the cellular levels of let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21 affected the potencies of a number of the anticancer agents by up to 4-fold. The effect was most prominent with mir-21, with 10 of 28 cell-compound pairs showing significant shifts in growth-inhibitory activity. Varying mir-21 levels changed potencies in opposite directions depending on compound class; indicating that different mechanisms determine toxic and protective effects. In silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Conversely, expression of other miRNAs was detected at varying levels predominantly within luminal epithelial cells in normal tissue; expression of miR-21 was frequently increased, whereas that of let-7a was decreased in malignant cells. We describe a novel EMT-specific microRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic microRNA associated with carcinogenesis. Notable was the high expression of miR-21 and miR-205. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key actors in carcinogenesis and we demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21), oncomiR is expressed early during PDA. These results indicated that miR-21 plays a role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of O. viverrini-associated CCA by suppressing the function of PDCD4. Importantly, in patients with IBD CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 overexpression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (P < 0.001). Ectopic overexpression of miR-21 promoted Akt activation and phosphorylation of EZH2, whereas inhibiting miR-21 by transfecting the cells with anti-miR-21 inhibited Akt activation and EZH2 phosphorylation. PDCD4 nuclear down-regulation (which parallels miR-21 up-regulation) is involved in the molecular pathway of IBD-associated carcinogenesis. The expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.027), miR-181b (p = 0.002) and miR-146b (p = 0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p = 0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with overall survival of patients. OBJECTIVE: As an important oncogenic miRNA, miR-21 has been reported to play crucial roles in glioblastoma (GBM) carcinogenesis. We further analyzed the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21), an oncogenic noncoding RNA involved in oncogenic Ras signaling, by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis and is considered as one of the most studied oncomiRNAs. Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis, its functions and molecular mechanisms in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis are unclear. Substantial evidence indicates that microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key oncomiR in carcinogenesis and is significantly elevated in multiple myeloma (MM). MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis. Conversely, pAkt and miR-21 expression was significantly up-regulated in the whole spectrum of preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions considered. Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in virtually all types of carcinomas and various types of hematological malignancies. As expected, miR-21 expression was significantly upregulated in preneoplastic/neoplastic samples, consistent with PDCD4 downregulation. Furthermore, miR-21 levels in the primary tumours correlated with disease stage (P < 0.0001). We found that miR-16 and miR-21 were upregulated upon nicotine stimulation, transfection with anti-miR-16 or anti-miR-21 significantly abrogated cell proliferation. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a unique miRNA in that it is overexpressed in most tumour types analysed so far. Although altered expressions of miR-21 and miR-34a were manifested within cancer cells, those of miR-126 and miR-155 were predominantly confined to endothelial cells and immune cells, respectively. However, the function of miR-21 in osteosarcoma is still unclear. In SCC patients, we found elevated miR-21 and reduced miR-375 expression levels in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. Precancerous adenomas also frequently showed miR-21 up-regulation. Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) Importantly, the inflammatory ZD esophagus had a distinct microRNA signature resembling human ESCC or tongue SCC miRNAomes with miR-31 and miR-21 as the top-up-regulated species. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some upregulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the miRNAs that are frequently and highly overexpressed in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; however, only a little is known about its functional role in CRC. Inhibition of microRNA-21 (mir‑21) induced upregulation of Spry2             and PTEN which underscores the importance of mir-21 in Spry2-associated tumorigenesis             of the colon. The microRNA miR-21, a known oncogenic miRNA, was found to be upregulated in papillary and clear cell carcinomas. Since microRNA-21 (miR-21) may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in many cancer types, we aimed to investigate its efficacy in TCCs. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some up-regulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. In this study, by using high-throughput microRNA profiling, we identified that two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-148a) overexpressed in CD4+ T cells from both patients with lupus and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, which promote cell hypomethylation by repressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. The microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The contribution of overexpressed microRNA-21 and -221 (miR-21 and miR-221) to the malignant phenotype was determined by inhibiting these miRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides. The microRNA-21(miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including cervical cancer. To determine the functions of these microRNAs in lymphomagenesis, we examined the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting miR-21 (ASO-21) and/or miR-155 (ASO-155) in NK-cell lymphoma lines overexpressing one or both of these miRNAs. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 28 cases of never-smoker lung cancer identified aberrantly expressed miRNAs, which were much fewer than in lung cancers of smokers and included miRNAs previously identified (e.g., up-regulated miR-21) and unidentified (e.g., down-regulated miR-138) in those smoker cases. The oncogenic miRNA, microRNA-21 (miR-21), was found to be upregulated in laryngeal carcinoma tissues. OBJECTIVE: To better understand microRNA miR-21 function in carcinogenesis, we analyzed miR-21 expression patterns in different stages of colorectal cancer development using in situ hybridization (ISH). Of these miRNAs, miR-21 appears to be important in tumorigenesis given its up-regulation in almost all types of human cancer examined. The microRNA-21 gene (mir-21) has been identified as the only miRNA commonly overexpressed in solid tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, brain, head and neck, esophagus and pancreas. RESULTS: Our data showed that a common pattern of microRNA expression distinguishes any tumor type from normal pancreas, suggesting that this set of microRNAs might be involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis; the expression of miR-103 and miR-107, associated with lack of expression of miR-155, discriminates tumors from normal; a set of 10 microRNAs distinguishes endocrine from acinar tumors and is possibly associated with either normal endocrine differentiation or endocrine tumorigenesis; miR-204 is primarily expressed in insulinomas and correlates with immunohistochemical expression of insulin; and the overexpression of miR-21 is strongly associated with both a high Ki67 proliferation index and presence of liver metastasis. To search for tumor-associated mutations that could affect processing and expression of mature miRNAs, a panel of 91 cancer-derived cell lines was analyzed for sequence variations in 15 miRNAs implicated in tumorigenesis by virtue of their known target transcripts (let-7 family targeting oncogenic Ras) or their localization to sites of frequent chromosomal instability (miR-143, miR-145, miR-26a-1, and miR-21).", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Polo-like kinase 2 regulates selective autophagic α-synuclein clearance and suppresses its toxicity in vivo Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PLK2 is a previously undescribed regulator of α-synuclein turnover and that modulating its kinase activity could be a viable target for the treatment of synucleinopathies.  α-Synuclein increased PLK2 levels and GSK-3β activity and increased the levels of phosphorylated α-Synuclein and Tau Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Several neurological diseases, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 (p-Ser-129) Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons.

This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes.

Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) protects our cells from genomic instability in part by facilitating the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). BRCA1 promotes the error-free repair of DSBs through homologous recombination and is also implicated in the regulation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair fidelity. The increased frequency of DSB mutagenesis and MMEJ repair in the absence of BRCA1 suggests a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis. Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. Loss of p15/Ink4b accompanies tumorigenesis triggered by complex DNA double-strand breaks. Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells. Zinc chromate induces chromosome instability and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Our study shows that zinc chromate induced concentration-dependent increases in cytotoxicity, chromosome damage and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells.

Nitric oxide and acid induce double-strand DNA breaks in Barrett's esophagus carcinogenesis via distinct mechanisms. DNA double-strand break repair capacity and risk of breast cancer. A tumorigenic role of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been suggested by our finding of a significant association between increased breast cancer risk and a cooperative effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NHEJ genes. Carcinogen-induced DNA double strand break repair in sporadic breast cancer. Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis. Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects. Abnormal DNA end-joining activity in human head and neck cancer. In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired primarily by the DNA end-joining (EJ) process and thus, abnormal DNA EJ activities lead to an accumulation of mutations and/or aneuploidy, resulting in genetic instability of cells. Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB). However, an acquired deficiency in repairing DNA double strand breaks can be one mechanism promoting progression towards malignancy, possibly through impairing chromosomal stability. Recent findings demonstrate that accelerated carcinogenesis following liver regeneration is associated with chronic inflammation-induced double-strand DNA breaks in cells, which escaped apoptosis due to proliferative stress. Although DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis may relate to arsenite-induced damage and carcinogenesis, the mechanism of action remains obscure.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments.

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We identified 98 elements ≥80 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.

{"question": "Does surgery for ovarian endometriomas improve fertility?", "context": "CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment. Amongst the 38 women desiring pregnancy after endometrioma surgery, 19 (50%) achieved a spontaneous pregnancy during the follow-up period.  Of 33 women who wished to conceive, 67% became pregnant, spontaneously in 59% CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and pregnancy rates are encouraging in that they seem comparable to the best reported results after endometrioma cystectomy.  While laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. Surgery is considered to play a role within the framework of the therapeutic options to cure infertile women with the disease even though its effectiveness is generally modest.  Randomized controlled trials showed that the excision technique is associated with a higher pregnancy rate and a lower rate of recurrence although it may determine severe injury to the ovarian reserve.  Surgical treatment is associated with a high recurrence rate and its employment for women undergoing assisted conception has recently been challenged. Laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over expectant management.  For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). here is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40 CI 0.47-4.15) .  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a context of more than one year infertility only related to endometriosis, it is reasonable to offer these patients a complete operative laparoscopic treatment of their lesions, which enables 65% of them to be pregnant within a 8.5 months post-surgical median time to pregnancy and spontaneously in 60%.   It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile.  Surgery is an option for treatment, but there is no convincing evidence that it promotes a significant improvement in fertility. In conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.  Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the patients and fertility rate was 45%. The long-term results, especially the fertility outcome, have been promising: 12 of 20 women (60%) achieved a term pregnancy following a laparoscopic endometrioma procedure alone.  Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility. Removal of endometriomas before in vitro fertilization does not improve fertility outcomes: a matched, case-control study. Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes. Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment.

{"question": "Are ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?", "context": "Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a group of congenital myopathies, characterized by the presence of distinct rod-like inclusions \"nemaline bodies\" in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers. To date, ACTA1, NEB, TPM3, TPM2, TNNT1, and CFL2 have been found to cause NM. Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein.  Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1.  Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle.  Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes.  We report muscle MRI findings of 10 patients from 8 families with nemaline myopathy. Patients with involvement of the nebulin (NEB) gene showed a consistent pattern of selective muscle involvement corresponding to clinical severity. Patients with nemaline myopathy secondary to mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene showed diffuse involvement of thigh and leg muscles with relative sparing of the gastrocnemii. Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness ranging in severity. Three major forms have been identified: actin myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, and nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common of these myopathies and is further subdivided into seven groups according to severity, progressiveness, and age of onset. At present, five genes have been linked to congenital myopathies. These include alpha-actin (ACTA1), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (TPM3 and TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), and nebulin (NEB).  Nemaline myopathy is a structural congenital myopathy which may show both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations in three different genes have been identified as the cause of nemaline myopathy: the gene for slow alpha-tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) at 1q22-23, the nebulin gene (NEB) at 2q21.1-q22, and the actin gene (ACTA1) at 1q42. Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression. Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42.

Other treatment options may include pharmacologic interventions such as modafinil and armodafinil, which have shown efficacy in this population. BACKGROUND: Armodafinil (Nuvigil(®), Cephalon, Inc., Frazer, PA, USA), the longer-lasting isomer of racemic modafinil, is a nonamphetamine, wakefulness-promoting medication. In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication. Its efficacy and tolerability have been established in 12-week studies of patients with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), shift work disorder (SWD), or narcolepsy.  Armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with ES associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy. The wakefulness-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil are FDA approved for the treatment of ES in patients with SWD. CONCLUSIONS: Armodafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition related to excessive sleepiness as rated by the CGI-C and was well tolerated in patients with treated OSA and comorbid depression. CONCLUSION: In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic SWD of moderate or greater severity, armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness during scheduled night work, raising mean nighttime sleep latency above the level considered to indicate severe sleepiness during the daytime. Armodafinil also significantly improved measures of overall clinical condition, long-term memory, and attention.  Adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness, long-term memory, and patients' ability to engage in activities of daily living in nCPAP-adherent individuals with ES associated with OSA.  A number of studies have evaluated countermeasures or interventions in shift workers; proposed treatments include chronobiotic interventions, such as light exposure, melatonin, hypnotic agents, caffeine and CNS stimulants (amphetamine), and the wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil.  These studies showed that modafinil and armodafinil significantly improve the ability to sustain wakefulness during waking activities (e.g. working, driving), overall clinical condition, and sustained attention or memory in patients with SWSD.  CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition.

{"question": "Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics?", "context": "A major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs, which has given rise to the field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics' through 'Pharmaco-miRs'. miRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. The potential modulation of toxicology-related changes in miRNA expression, the role of miRNA in immune-mediated drug-induced liver injuries, the use of circulating miRNAs in body fluids as potential toxicological biomarkers, and the link between miRNA-related pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions are highlighted. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human. Pharmacogenomics genes can be divided into drug target genes termed as pharmacodynamics genes (PD) and genes involved in drug transport and metabolism termed as pharmacokinetics genes (PK). To clarify the regulatory potential of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by miRNAs of PK and PD genes. Our analysis identify a striking difference in the level of miRNA regulation between PK and PD genes, with the former having less than half predicted conserved miRNA binding sites compared with the latter. Importantly, this finding is reflected in a highly significant difference in the shift in expression levels of PD versus PK genes after depletion of miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes an intrinsic difference between PK and PD genes and helps clarify the role of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and small RNA expression analysis are three of the most active research topics in the biological, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and toxicological fields. All of these studies are based on gene expression analysis, which requires reference genes to reduce the variations derived from different amounts of starting materials and different efficiencies of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. In contrast, hTBCA and small RNAs are more stable during drug treatment, and they are better reference genes for pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. Polymorphisms of genes involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes underlie the divergent drug responses among individuals. A panel of drug-response genes was constructed, which contains 923 pharmacokinetic genes, 703 pharmacodynamic genes and 720 miRNAs. miRNA variations can affect drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues of pharmacogenomics research. we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. n silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Ten of those microRNAs have already been implicated in cancer biology. Our results support a substantial role for microRNAs in anticancer drug response, suggesting novel potential approaches to the improvement of chemotherapy. The NCI-60 has also been profiled for mRNA and protein expression, mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA copy number, generating an unparalleled public resource for integrated chemogenomic studies. To complement the existing NCI-60 data sets, we have measured expression levels of microRNAs in the NCI-60 and incorporated the resulting data into the CellMiner program package for integrative analysis. . Comparison of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance. Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance.

{"question": "Is nicotinamide effective for skin cancer prevention?", "context": "Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses. ESULTS: At 12 months, the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers was lower by 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 38) in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group (P=0.02). Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05). The number of actinic keratoses was 11% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group at 3 months (P=0.01), 14% lower at 6 months (P<0.001), 20% lower at 9 months (P<0.001), and 13% lower at 12 months (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide is a safe, widely available vitamin that reduces the immune suppressive effects of UV, enhances DNA repair in keratinocytes and has shown promise in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.   In summary, nicotinamide, by enhancing DNA repair in melanocytes, is a potential agent for the chemoprevention of cutaneous melanoma. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) prevents UV-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis in mice, and solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced immunosuppression in humans. These results show that nicotinamide enhances two different pathways for repair of UV-induced photolesions, supporting nicotinamide's potential as an inexpensive, convenient and non-toxic agent for skin cancer chemoprevention. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers. No noteworthy between-group differences were found with respect to the number or types of adverse events during the 12-month intervention period, and there was no evidence of benefit after nicotinamide was discontinued.CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 386 participants who had had at least two nonmelanoma skin cancers in the previous 5 years to receive 500 mg of nicotinamide twice daily or placebo for 12 months.  Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05).  Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.

{"question": "Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?", "context": "The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.  The stridor was specific to MSA.  Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure. Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.  DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.  . Her dyspneic attacks consisting of inspiratory stridor and cyanosis occurred mainly during the wearing-off time and continued for less than 30 min The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.  A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously. The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.  Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA. Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease. OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients were identified.  This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management. RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients were identified. This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients, as this affects management.

{"question": "Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?", "context": "In addition, IL-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke. After appropriate adjustment, the odds ratios for the association of markers and poor outcome (comparing the upper and the lower third) were interleukin-6, 3.1 (95% CI: 1.9-5.0); C-reactive protein, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2-3.1); fibrinogen, 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.36); white cell count, 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3-3.4); and glucose 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.  -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54).  In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome. Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.  Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000). In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity.

{"question": "Is macroautophagy a selective degradation process?", "context": "Selective autophagy Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a bulk degradation system for cytoplasmic components and is ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells Here we show that selective autophagy downregulates Ty1 transposition We propose that selective autophagy safeguards genome integrity against excessive insertional mutagenesis caused during nutrient starvation by transposable elements in eukaryotic cells. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that proteins, organelles, and pathogens can be targeted for autophagic clearance by selective mechanisms Cell spreading required ref(2)P, the Drosophila p62 multiadaptor, implicating selective autophagy as a novel mechanism for modulating cortical dynamics The selective macroautophagic degradation There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk cytosol in response to starvation and can occur selectively for substrates, including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, whether starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adaptor molecules to capture their cargo. Here, we report that Alfy, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective elimination of aggregated proteins. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in selective macroautophagy by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that builds autophagosomes. Thus, cytoplasmic NBR1 might be important to maintain basal levels of selective macroautophagy in these neurons. we could show that Smatg8 and Smatg4 are not only required for nonselective macroautophagy, but for selective macropexophagy as well. The latter is performed by proteasome-mediated degradation, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and selective macroautophagy, Here we demonstrate a role for PtdIns 4-kinases and PtdIns4P 5-kinases in selective and nonselective types of autophagy in yeast. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a degradative cellular pathway that protects eukaryotic cells from stress, starvation, and microbial infection. Previously, we showed that macroautophagy is necessary for conidiation in the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we analyzed the physiological function(s) of selective autophagy in Magnaporthe Serine 403 phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 regulates selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Selective macroautophagy (autophagy) of ubiquitinated protein is implicated as a compensatory mechanism of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p62/SQSTM1 is a key molecule managing autophagic clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins. Whole organelle turnover is mediated through macroautophagy, a process by which autophagosomes deliver mitochondria to the lysosome for hydrolytic degradation. While mitochondrial autophagy can occur as part of a nonselective upregulation of autophagy, selective degradation of damaged or unneeded mitochondria (mitophagy) is a rapidly growing area in development, cancer, and neurodegeneration, particularly with regard to Parkinson's disease BAG3 was recently described as a mediator of a novel macroautophagy pathway that uses the specificity of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to misfolded proteins and also involves other protein partners, such as HSPB8. two Parkinson disease (PD) associated genes, PINK1 and Parkin, were shown to mediate the degradation of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) Here we show that whole mitochondria are turned over via macroautophagy. Does Huntingtin play a role in selective macroautophagy? In the discussion here I suggest that Htt may have a normal function in the lysosomal mechanism of selective macroautophagy involved in its own degradation Macroautophagy induced by ethanol seemed to be selective for damaged mitochondria and accumulated lipid droplets, but not long-lived proteins, which could account for its protective effects Although macroautophagy can be nonspecific, there are many examples of selective sequestration including pexophagy, mitophagy and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy) is the process of selective degradation of mitochondria that has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. One of the genes identified, YLR356W, is required for mitophagy, but not for macroautophagy or other types of selective autophagy. A genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in selective mitochondria autophagy. Mitophagy is the process of selective mitochondrial degradation via autophagy, which has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. Analysis of this set of targeted deletion mutants demonstrated that loss of any of the 16 genes necessary for nonselective macroautophagy renders the fungus unable to cause rice blast disease, due to impairment of both conidial programmed cell death and appressorium maturation. In contrast, genes necessary only for selective forms of autophagy, such as pexophagy and mitophagy, are dispensable for appressorium-mediated plant infection. This gene is not required for other types of selective autophagy or for nonspecific macroautophagy. However, in contrast to the core autophagy genes such as atg5 and atg7, expression of ulk1 is not essential for induction of macroautophagy in response to nutrient deprivation or for survival of newborn mice. Together, these data suggest that the ATG1 homologue, Ulk1, is a component of the selective autophagy machinery that leads to the elimination of organelles in erythroid cells rather that an essential mechanistic component of autophagy. Growing evidence supports an active role for dysregulated macroautophagy (autophagic stress) in neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. Alterations in mitochondrial function and dynamics are also strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, whereas the core autophagy machinery is evolutionarily conserved and shared among constitutive and induced or selective autophagy, recent studies implicate distinct mechanisms regulating mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in response to general autophagic stimuli. We discovered that activation of the UPR in yeast also induces a new branch of macroautophagy that selectively targets the ER. We term this process \"ER-phagy\", in analogy to pexophagy and mitophagy, the two other known forms of organelle-specific marcoautophagy. ER-phagy involves the generation of autophagosomes that selectively include ER membranes and whose delimiting double membranes also derive, at least in part, from the ER. This suggests that in fungi an organism-specific form of selective autophagy may occur, for which specialized Atg proteins have evolved. ransfer of Y. lipolytica cells from oleate/ethylamine to glucose/ammonium chloride medium leads to selective macroautophagy of peroxisomes. Insulin-dependent signaling regulates azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy in human myeloblastic cells. We show that insulin-dependent signals regulate azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy in human myeloid cells. By contrast, other organelles, including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus remained intact, indicating that the macroautophagy selectively targeted azurophil granules. Thus, insulin-dependent signals are responsible for the control of azurophil granule-selective macroautophagy via Akt-dependent pathways Eukaryotic cells have the ability to degrade proteins and organelles by selective and nonselective modes of micro- and macroautophagy. For example, pexophagy is a selective process for the regulated degradation of peroxisomes by autophagy. We have characterized biochemically, morphologically, and genetically two distinct pathways for the selective degradation of peroxisomes in Pichia pastoris. These pathways are independently regulated and analogous to microautophagy and macroautophagy that have been defined in mammalian cells. If we are willing to slightly modify our definition of autophagy, with a focus on \"degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery,\" we can include a newly documented process, programmed nuclear destruction (PND). Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that can sequester cytosolic material, including organelles, nonspecifically in a process called nonselective macroautophagy, or target specific protein aggregates designated for destruction in a process called selective autophagy. Selective macroautophagy uses double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, to transport cytoplasmic pathogens, organelles and protein complexes to the vacuole for degradation. Autophagy (macroautophagy), a highly conserved eukaryotic mechanism, is a non-selective degradation process, helping to maintain a balance between the synthesis, degradation and subsequent recycling of macromolecules to overcome various stress conditions. Whole organelle turnover is mediated through macroautophagy, a process by which autophagosomes deliver mitochondria to the lysosome for hydrolytic degradation. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which the cell degrades cytoplasmic components through the lysosomal machinery. Macroautophagy maintains cellular homeostasis through targeting cytoplasmic contents and organelles into autophagosomes for degradation. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which cytosolic components are sequestered by double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and sorted to the lysosomes/vacuoles to be degraded. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular degradation process, which in yeast is induced in response to nutrient deprivation. Macroautophagy was thought to be an unspecific bulk degradation process. Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular degradation process by which cells remove cytosolic long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, and can be monitored by imaging the incorporation of microtubule-associated light chain 3 (LC3) fused to a fluorescent protein (GFP or mCherry) into nascent autophagosomes. Beside macroautophagy, there are several forms of selective autophagy, including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt), pexophagy and mitophagy. Macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy) is the process by which intact organelles and/or large portions of the cytoplasm are engulfed within double-membraned autophagic vacuoles for degradation. This analysis demonstrated that Atg proteins required for non-selective macroautophagy are conserved from yeast to man, stressing the importance of this process in cell survival and viability.

Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients. The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials. No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day. The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks  At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo atients received fixed (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/day; n=1,342) or flexible doses (100-400 mg/day; n=463) of desvenlafaxine or placebo (n=1,108) Desvenlafaxine demonstrated short-term efficacy for treating major depressive disorder across the range of doses studied. No evidence of greater efficacy was observed with doses >50 mg/day; a strong dose-response effect on tolerability was observed. To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018)  These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD.  CONCLUSIONS: Desvenlafaxine at the recommended dose of 50 mg/d was effective in relapse prevention of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label desvenlafaxine treatment.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy, postpartum, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, heavy uterine bleeding, cancer and following surgery. We estimate the budget impact (BI) on the Swiss mandatory health insurance associated with substituting iron sucrose (standard) with ferric carboxymaltose (new treatment) using real-life data. reating iron deficiency involves substantial costs to the Swiss MHI which may be reduced by substituting iron sucrose with ferric carboxymaltose. e aim of this study was to observe, in a non-interventional way, how Swedish gastroenterologists adhere to guidelines in IBD outpatients treated with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), and the result of treatment FCM lowers platelet counts and platelet activation in patients with IBD-associated secondary thrombocytosis. We performed a randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD with secondary thrombocytosis (platelets > 450 G/L) e performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) prevents anemia in patients with IBD and low levels of serum ferritin FCM prevents recurrence of anemia in patients with IBD, compared with placebo.   A subgroup was analyzed regarding efficacy and side effects of iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose. Iron deficiency and anemia are frequent in IBD patients. Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose is efficious, safe and well tolerated in iron-deficient IBD patients.  Intravenous iron avoids these concerns, especially with the development of ferric carboxymaltose, which allow up to 1000mg to be given rapidly. What is the optimal treatment for anemia in inflammatory bowel disease? We compared the efficacy and safety of a novel fixed-dose ferric carboxymaltose regimen (FCM) with individually calculated iron sucrose (IS) doses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IDA Study drugs were well tolerated and drug-related adverse events were in line with drug-specific clinical experience  The simpler FCM-based dosing regimen showed better efficacy and compliance, as well as a good safety profile, compared with the Ganzoni-calculated IS dose regimen. Ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered in doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, up to a ceiling dose of 1000 mg. A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indication  Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron. The clinical situations where high doses of iron are commonly required are reviewed. These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment.  Ferric carboxymaltose can be administered at 15 mg/kg body weight to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, whereas iron isomaltoside 1000 can be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight. The ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia in a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high (including chronic blood loss associated with inflammatory bowel disease, menorrhagia, and chronic kidney disease) erric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in nine, Phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter trials in a diverse range of indications, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), post-partum anemia (PPA) or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), chronic heart failure (CHF), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing hemodialysis (HD In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf.

FeCarb is effective and safe in IBD-associated anemia. It is noninferior to FeSulf in terms of Hb change over 12 wk, and provides a fast Hb increase and a sufficient refill of iron stores. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 28.5% of the FeCarb and 22.2% of the FeSulf groups, with discontinuation of study medication due to AEs in 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively.

Genome-wide significant associations in schizophrenia to ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8, and extensive replication of associations reported by the Schizophrenia PGC. After combining the new schizophrenia data with those of the PGC, variants at three loci (ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8) that had not previously been GWS in schizophrenia attained that level of support. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10(-9)), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10(-8)) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10(-9)). Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4.  A recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of ITIH3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in Caucasian populations. We detected a novel association between suicide attempt and the ITIH3/4-region in a combined group of patients with BD, SCZ and related psychosis spectrum disorders.

{"question": "Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?", "context": "The role of EZH2 in the regulation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate cancer cells EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells. Overexpression of EZH2 confers an invasive phenotype on benign prostate epithelial cells EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells he transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells. Expression levels of the novel tumor and metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) have been shown to correlate negatively with those of EZH2 in breast and prostate cell lines as well as in clinical cancer tissues Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes the histone methyltransferase component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed widely in breast and prostate cancers and epigenetically silences tumor suppressor genes However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of EZH2 in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain unknown c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 were defined to modulate the behavior of prostate cancer with pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral effects and had ability in predicting prostate cancer progression, but the research of their co-expression value of prognosis is rarely Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly. EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been in the limelight of the field of cancer epigenetics for a decade now since it was first discovered to exhibit an elevated expression in metastatic prostate cancer a comprehensive overview of EZH2 in the context of prostate cancer EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer ChIP data on prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines suggested EZH2 occupancy and H3K27Me3 marks on the ID4 promoter Collectively, our data indicate a PRC2 dependent mechanism in ID4 promoter silencing in prostate cancer through recruitment of EZH2 and a corresponding increase in H3K27Me3. Increased EZH2 but decreased ID4 expression in prostate cancer strongly supports this model. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has recently attracted considerable attention because of its dysregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) and its important function in PCa development.  Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. The data show that amplification of the EZH2 gene is rare in early prostate cancer, whereas a fraction of late-stage tumors contains the gene amplification leading to the overexpression of the gene, thus indicating the importance of EZH2 in the progression of prostate cancer. EZH2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether EZH2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype. Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN. As a result, five EZH2 peptides recognized by IgG (EZH2 120-128, EZH2 165-174, EZH2 569-577, EZH2 665-674, and EZH2 699-708) were frequently detected in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. EZH2 promotes proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. The polycomb group protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate cancer. Mutation screen and association study of EZH2 as a susceptibility gene for aggressive prostate cancer. Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. The gene for polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is amplified in late-stage prostate cancer. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a kind of transcriptional repressor, is reportedly over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer. IgGs reactive to three EZH2 peptides (EZH2-243 to -252, EZH2-291 to -299, and EZH2-735 to -;742) were detected in the plasma of almost half of prostate cancer patients. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Overexpression of EZH2 has been associated with the invasion and progression of malignant cancers, especially with the progression of prostate cancer. Antigens overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer are appropriate targets in anti-cancer immunotherapy, and one candidate is the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).  Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence in a training set of 103 patients (relative risk [RR] = 2.52, a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. PcG proteins EZH2, BMI1, and RING1 are associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical PSA recurrence of prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, Elevation of the chromatin repression factor enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH2) is associated with progression and poor prognosis in several human cancers including prostate cancer. Various proteins (α2-integrin, α6-integrin, CD117, CD133, EZH2, OCT3/4) are associated with a prostate cancer stem cell phenotype in cell lines and xenografts. Increased expression of EZH2 has been associated previously with invasive growth and aggressive clinical behavior in prostate and breast cancer, EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and may be useful in defining a cohort of high-risk patients. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. EZH2 expression is associated with high proliferation rate and aggressive tumor subgroups in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast. Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i.e., a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer.

{"question": "Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?", "context": "Our data demonstrate that engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level by this method leads to necessary crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including activation of Akt, mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, PKA/CREB, and inhibition of RhoA/ROCK that substantially increase human β-cell proliferation while maintaining the β-cell phenotype. The cross-talk role of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with GSK-3β as the key enzyme bridging these pathways, may contribute to the inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cells by hUC-MSCs. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3β, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K resulted in the downregulation of several members of the β-catenin pathway, including Fra-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Similar results were observed in vivo, as intratumoral injection of LY294002 downregulated the expression of the components of the β-catenin pathway and delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous LN229 xenografts. These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation, in part via repression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma growth Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affected beta-catenin signaling by activation [corrected] of GSK-3beta, [corrected] resulting in cytoplasmic retention of beta-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. These findings demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and beta-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease. Western blot analyses revealed that the recombinant Wnt ligand Wnt-3A increased phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta as well as accumulation of activated, nuclear beta-catenin. Chemical inhibition of PI3K abolished Wnt-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3beta and trophoblast motility but did not affect appearance of activated beta-catenin or Wnt/TCF reporter activity. The data suggest that Wnt-3A may activate canonical Wnt signaling and PI3K/AKT through distinct receptors. Mutational activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs in a wide variety of tumors, whereas activating Wnt pathway mutants are predominantly found in colon cancer. Because GSK3 is a key component of both pathways, it is widely assumed that active PI3K signaling feeds positively into the Wnt pathway by protein kinase B (PKB)-mediatefd inhibition of GSK3. n addition, PKB has been proposed to modulate the canonical Wnt signaling through direct stabilization and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Here, we show that compartmentalization by Axin of GSK3 prohibits cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways and that Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not modulated by activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. Our recent study revealed a second mechanism for Cby-mediated beta-catenin inhibition in which Cby cooperates with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to facilitate nuclear export of beta-catenin, following phosphorylation of Cby by Akt kinase. Therefore, our findings unravel a novel molecular mechanism regulating the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of beta-catenin and provide new insights into the cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. Here, we review recent literature concerning Cby function and discuss our current understanding of the relationship between Wnt and Akt signaling. As inappropriate activation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling causes late-onset GCT development and cross talk between the PI3K/AKT and WNT/CTNNB1 pathways has been reported, we tested whether these pathways could synergize in GCT. This explains why prostate tumors subjected to androgen ablation experience an increase in Akt phosphorylation, and suggest that the tumor compensates for the loss of one pathway with another. Different modes of interaction between the two pathways, including direct interaction, or regulation via downstream intermediates, such as the wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway, NF-kappaB, and the FOXO family of transcription factors, will be discussed. FGF signals are transduced through FGF receptor to the FRS2-GRB2-GAB1-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade to downregulate GSK3beta activity depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. Because GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin and SNAIL leads to FBXW1 (betaTRCP)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, GSK3beta downregulation results in the stabilization and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and SNAIL. Bridging the BMP and Wnt pathways by PI3 kinase/Akt and 14-3-3zeta Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cultures, dexamethasone (DEX) activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and inhibits a differentiation-related cell cycle that occurs at a commitment stage immediately after confluence. Here we show that DEX inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin levels and inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. These inhibitory activities are no longer observed in the presence of lithium, a GSK3beta inhibitor. DEX decreased the serum-responsive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt-Ser(473) within minutes, and this inhibition was also observed after 12 h. When the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was inhibited by wortmannin, DEX no longer inhibited beta-catenin levels. Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt. These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. These results suggest that inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/LEF axis and stimulation of HDAC1 cooperate to mediate the inhibitory effect of DEX on Wnt signaling and the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle. WISP-1 (Wnt-1-induced secreted protein) was identified as an oncogene regulated by the Wnt-1-beta-catenin pathway. Here it is shown that WISP-1 can activate the antiapoptotic Akt/PKB signaling pathway.  Our results show that both TGFβ1 and Wnt3a lead to increased accumulation of β-catenin, phosphorylation of AKT and p44/42 MAPK.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome These results demonstrate that the AS candidate drug topotecan acts predominantly through stabilizing R loops and chromatin decondensation at the paternally expressed PWS Snord116 locus. Our study holds promise for targeted therapies to the Snord116 locus for both AS and PWS. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of RNA expression from an imprinted region on chromosome 15 that includes SNRPN, SNORD115, and SNORD116.  Recently published data strongly suggest a role for the paternally expressed small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster, SNORD116, in PWS etiology. Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear.  Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS.  The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features. Both kits should be made available for accurate characterization of PWS/AS deletion subtypes as well as evaluating for IC and SNORD116 microdeletions. There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features.  Although the SNORD116 gene cluster has become a prime candidate for PWS, it cannot be excluded that other paternally expressed genes in the chromosomal region 15q11q13 contribute to the full phenotype. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?", "context": "This article discusses some of these unresolved issues, including the use of medications such as nimodipine, antifibrinolytics, statins, and magnesium; coiling or clipping for aneurysm securement; and the prevention and treatment of potential complications. The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study. The present results suggest that fasudil is equally or more effective than nimodipine for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and subsequent ischemic injury in patients undergoing surgery for SAH. Three studies (2 meta-analyses and 1 randomized controlled trial) demonstrated that nimodipine use confers benefits (reduced morbidity and mortality) for patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is the only preventative treatment that can be recommended. Nimodipine (Nimotop), HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (statins) and enoxaparin (Lovenox) were the only drugs with level-1 evidence available for the treatment of vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force. The calcium antagonist nimodipine has been shown to reduce the incidence of ischemic complications following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There was no significant difference in the incidence of DINDs (28 vs 30% in the peroral and intravenous groups, respectively) or middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (> 120 cm/second, 50 vs 45%, respectively). Clinical outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale was the same in both groups, and there was no difference in the number of patients with new infarctions on MR imaging. The results suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy between peroral and intravenous administration of nimodipine in preventing DINDs or cerebral vasospasm following SAH. the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia is reduced with nimodipine and avoiding hypovolemia A recommendations (standard) for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm with oral Nimodipine in good grade patients. Of the 75 patients initially considered for active treatment, 83% underwent surgery within 48 hours of rupture, all received nimodipine, 16% received tissue plasminogen activator to lyse subarachnoid or intraventricular clots, 40% underwent hypertensive treatment, and 7% underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm. All patients with aneurysmal SAH should be treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine, and in certain circumstances patients should receive anticonvulsants. The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature. Seven placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that nimodipine improves the outcome of patients with severe neurological damage due to cerebral vasospasm. In a series of 100 individuals with a ruptured supratentorial aneurysm, who were subjected to aneurysm operation in the acute stage and who subsequently received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the occurrence of DID with FND was reduced to 5%. There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use. Nimodipine is the only treatment that provided a significant benefit across multiple studies. Absence of symptomatic vasospasm, occurrence of low density areas associated with vasospasm on CT, and occurrence of adverse events were similar between the two groups. The clinical outcomes were more favorable in the fasudil group than in the nimodipine group (p = 0.040). The proportion of patients with good clinical outcome was 74.5% (41/55) in the fasudil group and 61.7% (37/60) in the nimodipine group. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus, poor outcome and occasionally death, after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Advances in diagnosis and treatment, principally nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations, and endovascular neuroradiology procedures, have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus to poor outcome and occasionally death. Advances in diagnosis and treatment-principally the use of nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations and endovascular neuroradiology procedures-have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remain common complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and yet therapies for cerebral vasospasm are limited. Despite a large number of clinical trials, only calcium antagonists have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness. The only proven therapy for vasospasm is nimodipine. nimodipine is indicated after SAH and tirilazad is not effective. Fasudil hydrochloride and nimodipine both showed inhibitory effects on cerebral vasospasm. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was five of 33 patients in the fasudil group and nine of 32 patients in the nimodipine group. Good recovery evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was achieved by 23 of 33 patients in the fasudil group and 19 of 34 patients in the nimodipine group.

The addition of high-dose tamoxifen to standard radiotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this study, in which tamoxifen was used in conjunction with radiotherapy, progression free survival was shown to be less good when compared with historical data HR = 3.1 (CI: 1.7-5.7). The addition of high-dose tamoxifen, although well tolerated, confers no clinical benefit to patients treated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated with standard radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin and high dose tamoxifen has similar response rates to other regimens for recurrent malignant gliomas and are probably equivalent to those found using tamoxifen as monotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered alone or in combination with tamoxifen is safe and moderately effective in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors such as high-dose tamoxifen and hypericin also have been used in the treatment of malignant gliomas.  Considering these facts, polyethylene-glycol-liposomal doxorubicin with and without tamoxifen was evaluated within two sequential Phase II trials performed at our institution.  In a parallel phase-II-study investigating post-operative treatment with tamoxifen (TAM), carboplatin and radiation therapy for glioblastomas, 16 of 49 patients (33%) showed multifocal recurrence, which developed after a mean of 46 weeks, raising the question of an association with therapy.

Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA.  Several alleles in the epitope-recognition part of the HLA molecule that show the highest association with RA susceptibility, also share a common string of amminoacid residues (the so-called shared-epitope hypothesis). Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4.  n particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. ssociation of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C.  This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) for association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort After initial completion of the Human Genome Project on the 16th February 2001, significant progress has been made in identifying other than HLA genome regions linked to the increased RA susceptibility. As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA. Recent advances have led to novel identification of genetic polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA.  In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations.  After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples. Although HLA-DRB1 is the main RA gene, it accounts for only part of the familial risk for RA. HLA-DRB1 alleles are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the development of RA in a given individual.

{"question": "Are EDNRB mutations involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease?", "context": "QTL analysis identifies a modifier locus of aganglionosis in the rat model of Hirschsprung disease carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations As reported previously, when the same null mutation of the Ednrb gene, Ednrb(sl), was introgressed into the F344 strain, almost 60% of F344-Ednrb(sl/sl) pups did not show any symptoms of aganglionosis, appearing healthy and normally fertile. Genetic background strongly modifies the severity of symptoms of Hirschsprung disease, but not hearing loss in rats carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations In this study, we found that the null mutation of the Ednrb gene, thought indispensable for enteric neuron development, is insufficient to result in HSCR disease when bred onto a different genetic background in rats carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations. New roles of EDNRB and EDN3 in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implication of the EDN3 and EDNRB genes in a series of patients with Hirschsprung disease from Spain and determinate their mutational spectrum. A De Novo novel mutation of the EDNRB gene in a Taiwanese boy with Hirschsprung disease Although mutations in eight different genes (EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, SOX10, RET, GDNF, NTN, SIP1) have been identified in affected individuals, it is now clear that RET and EDNRB are the primary genes implicated in the etiology of HSCR. Mutations in genes of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) signaling pathways have been shown to be associated in HSCR patients.  Interactions between Sox10 and EdnrB modulate penetrance and severity of aganglionosis in the Sox10Dom mouse model of Hirschsprung disease Molecular genetic analyses have revealed that interactions between mutations in the genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are central to the genesis of HSCR Genome-wide association study and mouse model identify interaction between RET and EDNRB pathways in Hirschsprung disease Thus, genetic interaction between mutations in RET and EDNRB is an underlying mechanism for this complex disorder. EDNRB/EDN3 and Hirschsprung disease type II. Analysis of the RET, GDNF, EDN3, and EDNRB genes in patients with intestinal neuronal dysplasia and Hirschsprung disease wo susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene and the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene. We conclude that Ednrb loss only in neural crest cells is sufficient to produce the Hirschsprungs disease phenotype observed with genomic Ednrb mutations EDNRB mutations were detected in 2 of the 13 short-segment HD The mutations of EDNRB gene and EDN-3 gene are found in the short-segment HD of sporadic Hirschsprung's disease in Chinese population, which suggests that the EDNRB gene and EDN-3 gene play important roles in the pathogenesis of HD Functional characterization of three mutations of the endothelin B receptor gene in patients with Hirschsprung's disease Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is one the most common congenital intestinal disease. It leads to aganglionic megacolon in the early childhood. Several susceptibility genes have been identified : RET protooncogene and its ligand, glial cell derived neutrophic factor (GDNF), Sox 10, Endothelin-3 (EDN3) and its receptor B (EDNRB). EDNRB mutations are found in 5% of familial or sporadic HSCR Enteric aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease has been linked to genes coding for endothelin-3 (EDN3) and the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) To date, three genes have been identified as susceptibility genes for Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) Our data indicate that RET and EDNRB mutations have a role in the aetiology of some sporadically occurring HSCR Mutations of the endothelin-B receptor and endothelin-3 genes in Hirschsprung's disease The endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) have recently been recognized as susceptibility genes for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) These observations confirm that impaired function of the endothelin-B receptor or endothelin-3 is involved in the aetiology of some human HD cases. EDNRB mutations appear to be associated with short-segment HD, in contrast to RET mutations, which are found mainly in long-segment aganglionosis In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. Heterozygous endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) mutations in isolated Hirschsprung disease. QTL analysis identifies a modifier locus of aganglionosis in the rat model of Hirschsprung disease carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations. Homozygous mutations in the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) on 13q22 have been identified in humans and mice with Hirschsprung disease type 2 (HSCR2). A De Novo novel mutation of the EDNRB gene in a Taiwanese boy with Hirschsprung disease. Hitherto however, homozygosity for EDNRB mutations accounted for the HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. These data might suggest that EDNRB mutations could be dosage sensitive: heterozygosity would predispose to isolated HSCR with incomplete penetrance, while homozygosity would result in more complex neurocristopathies associating HSCR and WS features. Highly recurrent RET mutations and novel mutations in genes of the receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B pathways in Chinese patients with sporadic Hirschsprung disease. Mutations in genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are involved in HSCR pathogenesis; however, also important in ENS development are molecules that mediate events that are more restricted than those of RET and EDNRB, act later in development and which might not be HSCR-associated. Several missense mutations of the endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) associated with Hirschsprung disease have recently been identified. These findings indicate that these missense mutations result in loss of function of EDNRB, and may provide the molecular pathological basis of Hirschsprung disease in some individuals. Manifestation of the disease has been linked to mutations in genes that encode the crucial signals for the development of the enteric nervous system-the RET and EDNRB signalling pathways. In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease In this study, we investigated whether germline mutations of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB), a gene involved in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), could also predispose for malignant melanoma (MM) However, the similarity between the distal colonic aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease and that due to EDN3 or EDNRB mutations led to the hypothesis that levels of expression of these genes might be affected in the absence of mutation, thus causing the Hirschsprung disease phenotype Our data strongly suggest that EDNRB is involved in predisposition for two different multigenic disorders, HSCR and melanoma.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  Therefore, one could optogenetically activate specific or a mixed population of interneurons and dissect their selective or concerted inhibitory action on principal cells. We chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices. Our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration. Recently, a number of experiments have explored the treatments for epilepsy with optogenetic control of neurons. Here, we discuss the possibility that an optogenetic approach could be used to control the release of gliotransmitters and improve astrocyte function such as glutamate and K(+) uptake, and thereby offer a potential strategy to investigate and treat astrocyte-related epilepsy. Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits.

{"question": "Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?", "context": "Dysfunction of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), an established miR-1 target, during cardiac hypertrophy leads to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of AVB was higher in miR-1 Tg mice than that in wild-type (WT) mice.  As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these patients.  Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) reciprocally regulates inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir)2.1 expression in coronary disease, contributing to arrhythmogenesis.  miR-1 levels are greatly reduced in human AF, possibly contributing to up-regulation of Kir2.1 subunits, leading to increased I(K1). Because up-regulation of inward-rectifier currents is important for AF maintenance, these results provide potential new insights into molecular mechanisms of AF with potential therapeutic implications. The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins.  We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis, and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection. MiR-1 influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. In the presence of isoproterenol, rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely in control myocytes under the same conditions. Here we show that miR-1 is overexpressed in individuals with coronary artery disease, and that when overexpressed in normal or infarcted rat hearts, it exacerbates arrhythmogenesis. Elimination of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis.  Thus, miR-1 may have important pathophysiological functions in the heart, and is a potential antiarrhythmic target.

The situation becomes complex in archaea, where some groups have single and others have multiple origins of replication. Results from this in silico analysis show that the Themococcales have a single origin of replication. Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified.

{"question": "Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?", "context": "We previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which have a natural loss-of-function mutation in the Nik gene, which encodes a kinase essential for the processing of p100 to p52 in the alternative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, show mild osteopetrosis with an increase in several parameters of bone formation:  Proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 generates the active NF-kappaB2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.  The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation. NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis. Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB. Processing of NF-kappa B2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly regulated.  Processing of the NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is an important step of NF-kappaB regulation. Targeted disruption of the Rel/NF-kappaB family members NF-kappaB2, encoding p100/p52, and RelB in mice results in anatomical defects of secondary lymphoid tissues. Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52. nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105.  The alternative or second pathway proceeded via NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-, IKKalpha-, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the inhibitory NF-kappaB2 p100 precursor protein to the p52 form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily RelB-containing NF-kappaB dimers. In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degraded Proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B p105 (NFKB1) acts in a dual way as a cytoplasmic IkappaB molecule and as the source of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon processing The p50 subunit of NF-kappa B is derived from the amino terminus of a 105 kilodalton precursor Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB This effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50 NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

Rate and polarity of gene fusion and fission in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana We have identified all differentially composite or split genes in 2 fully sequenced plant genomes, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis. Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants--and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages--where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results. Primary factors correlating with fusion rates are the presence of transmembrane helices in HKs and the presence of DNA-binding domains in RRs, features that require correct (and separate) spatial location. In the absence of such features, there is a relative abundance of fused genes. We show that indels are the most frequent elementary events and that they occur in most cases at either the N- or C-terminus of the proteins. As revealed by the genomic neighbourhood/context of the corresponding genes, we show that a substantial number of these terminal indels are the consequence of gene fusions/fissions. We provide evidence showing that the contribution of gene fusion/fission to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins is lower-bounded by 27% and upper-bounded by 64%. We conclude that gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins. We found that fusion events are approximately four times more common than fission events, and we established that, in most cases, any particular fusion or fission event only occurred once during the course of evolution. Analyzing the most parsimonious pathways, we find 87% of architectures to gain complexity over time through simple changes, among which fusion events account for 5.6 times as many architectures as fission. These trees defined timelines of architectural discovery and revealed remarkable evolutionary patterns, including the explosive appearance of domain combinations during the rise of organismal lineages, the dominance of domain fusion processes throughout evolution, and the late appearance of a new class of multifunctional modules in Eukarya by fission of domain combinations We searched for examples which have arisen by one of the three postulated mechanisms: independent fusion/fission, \"duplication/deletion,\" and plasmid-mediated \"cut and paste.\" We conclude that all three mechanisms can be observed, with the independent fusion/fission being the most frequent.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Can cognitive behavioral therapy improve fatigue in cancer patients?", "context": "Physical activity, educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have the most supportive data and can be recommended to patients with confidence.  For women undergoing radiotherapy (3 RCTs), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy improved distress and fatigue. Patients in the CBT group reported a significantly larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group. However, relative to VCBT-I, PCBT-I was associated with significantly greater improvements of insomnia severity, early morning awakenings, depression, fatigue, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.  CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs.  No group differences in improvement were noted relative to QOL, fatigue, or mood.  In case of persistent fatigue, personalized cognitive behavioral therapy can be considered. ONCLUSION: The results support CBTH as an evidence-based intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.  Severe fatigue after cancer treatment can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it is unclear whether CBT has an effect on cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: CBT for post-cancer fatigue has already been shown to be an effective therapy.  Frequently reported side effects include cancer-related fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and psychological distress. Exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have counteracted such adverse effects in other cancer populations.  There is evidence from methodologically rigorous controlled trials that exercise, psycho-educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia are effective in the treatment of CRF, and a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions has shown initial promise in single-arm pilot studies with small, heterogeneous samples.  CONCLUSIONS: Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. RESULTS: Imagery/hypnosis and CBT/CST interventions have produced improvement in all the three cancer-related symptoms individually: pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that for weekly FACIT fatigue data, there was a significant effect of the CBTH intervention on the rate of change in fatigue (p < .05), such that on average, CBTH participants' fatigue did not increase over the course of treatment, whereas control group participants' fatigue increased linearly. ONCLUSION: The results suggest that CBTH is an effective means for controlling and potentially preventing fatigue in breast cancer radiotherapy patients.

{"question": "Is protein Fbw7 a SCF type of E3 ubiquitin ligase?", "context": "FBW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) is the substrate recognition component of an evolutionary conserved SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase. However, very few E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to target G-CSFR for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. FBW7 is a crucial component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates degradation of an array of different target proteins. F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7), the substrate-binding subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(FBW7) (a complex of SKP1, cullin-1 and FBW7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The tumor suppressor Fbxw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, hAgo, or Fbw7) is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recognition subunit of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and targets a group of oncoproteins for degradation.  Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ligase complex and a well-characterized tumor suppressor that targets numerous oncoproteins for destruction. Fbw7 is a member of F-box family proteins, which constitute one subunit of Skp1, Cul1, and F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. SCF(Fbw7) facilitates polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of various proteins such as Notch, cyclin E, c-Myc and c-Jun. Fbxw7 (also known as Fbw7, SEL-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein subunit of an Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a central role in the degradation of Notch family members. The Fbxw7 (F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7; also called CDC4, Sel10, Ago, and Fbw7) component of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex acts as a tumor suppressor in several tissues and targets multiple transcriptional activators and protooncogenes for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate here that Fbw7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7), the substrate recognition component of an SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of NSC/NPC viability and differentiation. The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability. F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (Fbw7) provides substrate specificity for the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets multiple oncoproteins for degradation, including cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).

The highest prevalence of urinary incontinence is reported in those participating in high impact sports. The prevalence of female stress urinary incontinence is high, and young adults are also affected, including athletes, especially those involved in \"high-impact\" sports Analysis of these data suggests that perineal pressure is decreased in female athletes compared with nonathlete women. A lower perineal pressure correlates with increased symptoms of urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. Urinary incontinence is a prevalent condition among athletes that is not openly discussed. High-level sport appears to be a significant independent risk factor for AI in healthy young women.  The prevalence of LUTS was 54.7%, and 30% for urinary incontinence. LUTS and incontinence are prevalent in female athletes. A relationship between sport or fitness activities and urinary incontinence (UI) previously has been described in women.  studies have also shown a high prevalence of SUI in young, physically fit female athletes.  There was urinary incontinence in female long-distance runners and a correlation with eating disorders. young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence. Results indicated that more than 25% of those completing surveys experienced incontinence and that more than 90% had never told anyone about their problem and had no knowledge of preventive measures; 16% reported incontinence negatively impacted their quality of life. There is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes. Women athletes should be counseled about the increased risk of urinary incontinence with ultra high-impact sports and eating disorders. Stress urinary incontinence is a barrier to women's participation in sport and fitness activities and, therefore, it may be a threat to women's health, self-esteem and well-being.

Since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs termed \"enhancer RNAs\" (eRNAs), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  A subset of enhancers are occupied by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs termed eRNAs.  Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.  In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.  Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established.

Analysis of the MethylCap-seq data revealed a strong positive correlation between replicate experiments and between paired tumor/lung samples. We identified 57 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) present in all NSCLC tumors analyzed by MethylCap-seq. While hypomethylated DMRs did not correlate to any particular functional category of genes, the hypermethylated DMRs were strongly associated with genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions and satellite repeats were hypomethylated in the NSCLC samples. We also identified DMRs that were specific to two of the major subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Collectively, we provide a resource containing genome-wide DNA methylation maps of NSCLC and their paired lung tissues, and comprehensive lists of known and novel DMRs and associated genes in NSCLC. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Genomewide DNA methylation analysis identifies novel methylated genes in non-small-cell lung carcinomas. To identify candidate markers for use in NSCLC diagnosis, we used genomewide DNA methylation maps that we had previously generated by MethylCap and next-generation sequencing and listed the most significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The 25 DMRs with highest significance in their methylation scores were selected. The methylation status of these DMRs was investigated in 61 tumors and matching control lung tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We found 12 novel DMRs that showed significant differences between tumor and control lung tissues.

{"question": "Is the protein product of the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) a deubiquitinating enzyme?", "context": "CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple benign neoplasms of the skin known as cylindromas. The CYLD protein is a deubiquitinating enzyme that acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and JNK signaling through its interaction with NEMO and TNFR-associated factor 2. CYLD, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), is a critical regulator of diverse cellular processes, ranging from proliferation and differentiation to inflammatory responses, via regulating multiple key signaling cascades such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. CYLD is a lysine 63-deubiquitinating enzyme that inhibits NF-κB and JNK signaling. Tumor suppressor gene CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme which negatively regulates various signaling pathways by removing the lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from several specific substrates. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has been implicated in various aspects of adaptive and innate immune responses.  The cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Brooke-Spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme acting as a negative regulator of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway by removing lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from NF-κB activating proteins.  Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, the familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene, as a negative regulator of proximal events in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. CYLD is a tumour-suppressor gene that is mutated in a benign skin tumour syndrome called cylindromatosis. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD), which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB.  CYLD, a tumor suppressor gene, has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD is correlated with tumorigenesis. We show that dCYLD encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that deubiquitinates dTRAF2 and prevents dTRAF2 from ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) form a family of cysteine proteases that digests ubiquitin chains and reverses the process of protein ubiquitination. Despite the identification of a large number of DUBs, their physiological functions remain poorly defined. Here we provide genetic evidence that CYLD, a recently identified DUB, plays a crucial role in regulating the peripheral development and activation of B cells. The cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Therefore, loss of CYLD function correlates with tumorigenesis. Cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinating enzyme, which interacts with members of the NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuates NF-κB and JNK signaling. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene (Cyld) encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD) with immunoregulatory function. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Here, we examined the potential role of the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD (cylindromatosis), mutation of which has been reported to cause familial cylindromatosis. The deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD), loss of which was originally reported to cause a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB in vitro. The CYLD gene product is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was shown to regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and inflammatory responses, mainly through inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling. Cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinating enzyme, which interacts with members of the NF-�B signaling pathway and attenuates NF-�B and JNK signaling.

Recent studies have uncovered functional roles of both JCN and triadin in the mouse heart, using transgenic overexpression strategies, which exhibit varying phenotypes including mild SR structural alterations, prolongation of Ca transient decay, impaired relaxation, and cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure. Triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.  Thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal SR Ca cycling and contractile function.

{"question": "Does nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?", "context": "The survival times were similar to those seen in historical data of standard therapy. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. The mean and median survival time for subjects treated with nimotuzumab was 31.06 and 17.76 vs. 21.07 and 12.63 months for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, nimotuzumab showed an excellent safety profile and significant survival benefit in combination with irradiation. Nimotuzumab was well-tolerated and treatment with the antibody yielded a survival benefit: median survival time was 32.66 mo and the 2-y survival rate was 54.2%. This study demonstrated the feasibility of prolonged administration of nimotuzumab and showed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in HGG patients with poor prognosis.  Recent clinical studies show that patients with malignant gliomas could benefit from nimotuzumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has moderate activity in patients with malignant gliomas and the toxicities are well tolerable, therefore, worth further investigation. It has been evaluated in malignant brain tumors in adults and children, and shown to be therapeutically safe and effective in terms of increased survival and improved quality of life.

{"question": "Is there an association between c-reactive protein concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?", "context": "Besides the baseline characteristics, daily interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte counts were prospectively measured until day 14 after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Occurrence of infectious complications and application of therapeutic hypothermia were assessed as confounding factors. The primary end point was outcome after 3 months, assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale; the secondary end point was the occurrence of DINDs. RESULTS: : During a 3-year period, a total of 138 patients were included. All inflammatory parameters measured were higher in patients with unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 1-3). Twenty-three and 28 patients showed poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm after SAH, respectively. Both preoperative and postoperative CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor outcome compared with patients with a good outcome (P<0.05). e area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CRP measured on postoperative day 1 or 2 (CRP POD1-2) for predicting a poor clinical outcome was 0.870, and its cutoff point of 4 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 0.826 and a specificity of 0.843. A high CRP level after aneurysm treatment was associated with severe neurological deterioration on admission, cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and surgical decompression (P<0.05). CRP POD1-2, and not the preoperative CRP, was an independent factor in predicting symptomatic vasospasm (P<0.05). In patients with symptomatic vasospasm, an increase in the postoperative CRP was associated with the time profile of developing symptomatic vasospasm. Postoperative CRP, especially CRP POD1-2, can be a useful prognostic factor for both poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Serum CRP levels were related to severity of aSAH. Patients with lower GCS scores and higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades presented statistically significant higher serum CRP levels. Patients with higher serum CRP levels had a less favorable prognosis. Increased serum CRP levels were strongly associated with worse clinical prognosis in this study. After SAH, the value of C-reactive protein (CRP)--an acute phase sensitive inflammatory marker--as a prognostic factor has been poorly studied, with conflicting results. Admission (18.0 ± 35.7 vs 8.5 ± 8.4 mg/l) and postoperative (41.0 ± 40.2 vs 21.1 ± 24.1 mg/l) CRP levels were higher (p < 0.001) in those with a poor outcome than in those with a favourable outcome, but CRP values did not predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or cerebral infarction. Higher increase in CRP level between admission and postoperative morning, however, independently predicted poor outcome (p = 0.004). CRP levels correlate with outcome but do not seem to predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or infarction after SAH. Systemic oxygen consumption is associated with hsCRP levels in the first 14 days after SAH and is an independent predictor of DCI. Intracranial hypertension was associated with an inflammatory response, indicating activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain (ECF) and systemic circulation with high IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels after SAH, the latter associated with unfavourable outcome. Patients with angiographic vasospasm had higher CRP measurements in serum and CSF, in a statistically significant fashion (p < 0.0001). Additionally, patients with higher CRP levels in serum and CSF had less favorable outcome in this cohort. Furthermore, patients developing angiographically proven vasospasm demonstrated significantly elevated CRP levels in serum and CSF, and increased CRP measurements were strongly associated with poor clinical outcome in this cohort. Finally, serum concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and hsCRP during the early (P = .0055, P = .0266, and P = .0266) and late (P = .0423, P = .0041, and P = .0004) period were significantly higher in patients with DIND than in patients without DIND. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and hsCRP during the early and late period following SAH correlate with DIND CRP levels on days 5, 6, 7, and 8 were statistically significantly higher in the group of patients developing a DIND (P < 0.025, P < 0.016, P < 0.011, P < 0.0002). Overall CRP values were higher with increasing severity of the initial ictus according to the Hunt and Hess Scale and to the outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale from day 3 on. The presented data do not prove that WBCs and CRP values have a direct contribution to the pathogenesis of ischemic complications following SAH, but it supports the assertion that inflammation may present a common pathogenic pathway in the development of such complications. The CRP and TGF-beta1 levels in CSF are strongly concerned with communicating hydrocephalus after SAH.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Transcription termination by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) occurs at sequences coding for a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC). In the 5' flanking region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I (approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately -116 to -103). Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA. Considering the extent of transcription through the human genome as well as the abundance of GC-rich and/or non-canonical DNA structure forming tandem repeats, RNA•DNA hybrids may represent a common mutagenic conformation.

{"question": "Are shadow enhancers associated with development?", "context": "Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain \"shadow\" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes \"bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions\" Shadow enhancers flanking the HoxB cluster direct dynamic Hox expression in early heart and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Regulatory analysis of the HoxA complex reveals that it also has enhancers in the 3' flanking region which contain RAREs and have the potential to modulate expression in endoderm and heart tissues This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. Together, the similarities in their location, enhancer output, and dependence on retinoid signaling suggest that a conserved cis-regulatory cassette located in the 3' proximal regions adjacent to the HoxA and HoxB complexes evolved to modulate Hox gene expression during mammalian cardiac and endoderm development.

{"question": "Does prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?", "context": "Using this approach, large prospective studies have reported reductions in CVD risk ranging from 10 to 60% in groups whose diets can be variously classified as ‘Healthy’, ‘Prudent’, Mediterranean’ or ‘DASH compliant’. Our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of MI, but not related to risk of VTE. The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet or \"prudent diet\" is associated with reduced risk of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly. In a large healthy Italian population, non-predefined dietary patterns including foods considered to be rather unhealthy, were associated with higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors, CRP and individual global CVD risk, whereas a \"prudent-healthy\" pattern was associated with lower levels. We observed an inverse association between the prudent pattern and AMI, with higher levels being protective. After multivariable adjustment, the prudent diet was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 40) and a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 10 to 24) when the highest quintile was compared with the lowest quintile.  Greater adherence to the prudent pattern may reduce the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality, whereas greater adherence to the Western pattern may increase the risk among initially healthy women.

{"question": "Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?", "context": "Here we refine our approach, and apply it to novel variants found in 2266 patients across two large cohorts with inherited sudden death syndromes, namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or Brugada syndrome (BrS). Calsequestrin-associated catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT2) can cause sudden death in young individuals in response to stress.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhood In many cases the cause of death can be elucidated by medico-legal autopsy, however, a significant number of these cases remain unexplained despite a detailed postmortem investigation and are labeled as sudden unexplained death (SUD). Post-mortem genetic testing, so called molecular autopsy, revealed that primary arrhythmogenic disorders including long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) may account for a certain number of these cases. We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryano Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  In conclusion, patients with CASQ2-associated CPVT should be recommended to receive ICDs to prevent sudden death when medical therapy is not effective.  Cardiac channelopathies associated with structurally normal hearts such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) yield no evidence to be found at autopsy, leaving coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists only to speculate that a lethal arrhythmia might lie at the heart of a sudden unexplained death (SUD). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood. We also compare CPVT to other notable cardiomyopathic and channelopathic causes of sudden death in youth including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts Early detection of CPVT is crucial because opportune medical intervention prevents sudden cardiac death.   If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease.  Hereditary non-structural diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT, and the Brugada syndrome as well as structural disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) cause a significant percentage of sudden cardiac deaths in the young Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms. Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases.  Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. The inherited arrhythmogenic diseases associated with the transmembranous ionic channels, anchoring proteins or intracellular calcium regulating proteins are thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death in infants, children, and young adults who have structurally normal hearts. Recent genetic analyses have identified congenital diseases such as the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the Brugada syndrome (BrS), the short-QT syndrome (SQTS), the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), and the catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) /familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (FPVT).

In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088).

{"question": "Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?", "context": "Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription, whose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages. Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand remarkable strand-bias of the distribution of essential genes Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. strand-biased gene distribution (SGD) SGD correlates not only with polC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS) In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. genes whose expression is important for fitness are selected to the leading strand because this reduces the duration of these interruptions Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  We show that the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection purging such mutants. Based on those experimentally determined for 10 bacteria, we find that essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand, for all the 10 genomes studied, confirming previous findings based on either smaller datasets or putatively assigned ones by homology search. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This paradox could be explained by assuming that the stronger mutation pressure and selection after inversion preferentially eliminate genes transferred from the leading to the lagging DNA strand. We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}
{"question": "Is c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?", "context": "The current study encompasses the investigation of simultaneous expression of four circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2) and three clock-controlled cell cycle genes (Myc, Cyclin D1 and Wee1) Our results suggest that aberrant expression of circadian clock genes can lead to aberrant expression of their downstream targets that are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis and hence may result in manifestation of CLL. Loss of Bmal1 reduced the expression of per1, per2, per3, wee1 and p53. The expression of p21 and c-myc was also altered in certain cell lines. In particular, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been documented to be under circadian regulation. The circadian expression of c-MYC is modulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in synchronized murine neuroblastoma cells. Our results, using the murine neuroblastoma cell line N2A, show that Per1 and c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels oscillate with the same phase. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that a significant decrease in c-Myc transcript and protein levels can be achieved after a short TSA treatment applied only at specific circadian times. This is also followed by a reduction in the proliferation rate of the cell population. Among the circadian output pathways, the rhythmic sympathetic signaling plays a key role in the central-peripheral timing mechanism that simultaneously activates the cell cycle clock via AP1-controlled Myc induction and p53 via peripheral clock-controlled ATM activation. Jet-lag promptly desynchronizes the central clock-SNS-peripheral clock axis, abolishes the peripheral clock-dependent ATM activation, and activates myc oncogenic potential, leading to tumor development in the same organ systems in wild-type and circadian gene-mutant mice. The results showed that over-expression of Per2 induced not only cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase but also an increase in apoptosis, which was confirmed by characteristic morphological changes, FCM and evident DNA fragmentation. Further experiments confirmed both up-regulation of P53 and down-regulation of CylinB1and C-myc. On the other hand, while P53 was found to be down-regulated. CylinB1 and C-myc were up-regulated. after Per2 knockdown. We also show that BMAL1 epigenetic inactivation impairs the characteristic circadian clock expression pattern of genes such as C-MYC, catalase, and p300 in association with a loss of BMAL1 occupancy in their respective promoters. Per2 mutant (Per2(m/m)) mice show an increase in lymphomas and deregulated expression of cyclin D and c-Myc genes that are key to proliferation control. The expression of cell cycle genes such as Wee1, Cyclins, and c-Myc are under circadian control and could be directly under the regulation of the circadian transcriptional complex.

Using non-invasive method of cffDNAs in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases. The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake. Nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffDNA in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method. Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women. Prevention of contamination following our anti-contamination criteria is a good practice for certain non-invasive sex determination, using cffDNA.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 directly interacts with SMN. This entity promotes the binding of a set of factors, termed LSm/Sm proteins, onto snRNA to form the core structure of these particles.  Toward an assembly line for U7 snRNPs: interactions of U7-specific Lsm proteins with PRMT5 and SMN complexes. In this report, we demonstrate that the coilin C-terminal domain binds directly to various Sm and Lsm proteins via their Sm motifs. We show that the region of coilin responsible for this binding activity is separable from that which binds to SMN. Thus, the ability to interact with free Sm (and Lsm) proteins as well as with intact snRNPs, indicates that coilin and CBs may facilitate the modification of newly formed snRNPs, the regeneration of 'mature' snRNPs, or the reclamation of unassembled snRNP components. Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively.

{"question": "Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?", "context": "We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression. The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an important role in the control of gene expression Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation. Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency. The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus We focus on the emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked. Cells face the challenge of storing two meters of DNA in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus that spans only a few microns. The nuclear organization that is required to overcome this challenge must allow for the accessibility of the gene regulatory machinery to the DNA and, in the case of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), for the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that accompany differentiation In this review we summarize some of the recent findings illuminating the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome, as well as the relationship between genome topology and function from the level of whole chromosomes to enhancer-promoter loops with a focus on features affecting genome organization in ESCs and changes in nuclear organization during differentiation We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

BRAF-mutated melanoma  The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been reported to be activated in over 80% of all cutaneous melanomas, making it the focus of many scientific studies in the melanoma field. Discoveries of mutations and aberrant expression of components in this cascade, in particular, BRAF and NRAS render a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease.   BRAF-targeted therapies (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have showed impressive results in systemic therapy for melanoma harboring activating BRAF V600E mutations.   An independent cohort of 91 archival MUPs was also screened for 46 hot spot mutations highly prevalent in melanoma including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11.  a high rate of BRAF (45 of 101, 45%) and NRAS (32 of 101, 32%) mutations, collectively indicating a mutation profile consistent with cutaneous sun-exposed melanomas. Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the BRAF inhibitors. BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma.  BRAF V600 selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma,  BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma  Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is rapidly evolving due to an improved understanding of molecular drivers of this disease. Somatic mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alteration found in these tumors.  genetically activated BRAF, is now commonly prescribed for metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation. BRAF inhibitors improve melanoma patient survival, but resistance invariably develops.  BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal.  Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors.  BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  (V600)BRAF mutation was identified as an ideal target for clinical therapy due to its indispensable roles in supporting melanoma initiation and progression. The Braf(V600E) mutation has been detected in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon, thyroid, and other cancers. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patient BRAF mutations occur in approximately 8% of all human cancers and approach 50% in melanoma and papillary carcinoma of thyroid. Vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the V600 mutant form of the BRAF protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer. Molecular studies demonstrated that the melanoma was positive for the 1799T>A (V600E) mutation in the BRAF gene. RAF kinase inhibitors have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas.  Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in approximately 50% of melanomas. More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  Personalized melanoma medicine has progressed from histopathologic features to serum markers to molecular profiles. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patients. The clinical activity of BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) therapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying BRAF mutations.  The discovery of BRAF mutations in melanoma led to the development of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients.  A majority of cutaneous melanomas show activating mutations in the NRAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes, components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in ∼50% of all melanomas has proved to be a turning point in the therapeutic management of the disseminated disease. This review summarizes the critical role of BRAF in melanoma pathophysiology, the clinical and pathological determinants of BRAF mutation status and finally addresses the current state of the art of BRAF inhibitors. To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution. The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177). BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system. A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)]. BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51.4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16.2%)] (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes. All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT). Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma. Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma.

{"question": "Does ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?", "context": "Clinical improvement depends not only on the capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.  After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.95 ± 0.44 vs 4.38 ± 0.68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of 48.7%.  Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous changes in the ventricular size. The remarkable and prompt improvement in the global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the current concept of \"neuronal plasticity\" and for the cells' reactivity in order to recover their metabolic function. Outcome of shunting in INPH is most often successful when patients are accurately diagnosed, suitably evaluated for surgical candidacy, and managed carefully throughout the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods. The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.e., a ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in favor of that procedure. Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.  During the 1st postoperative year, there was improvement in the condition of 22 patients (96%) who had received a ventricular shunt; 21 of these patients (91%) remained improved until death or for at least 5 years. Shunt treatment showed an effect on cognitive functions of distractibility of attention and motor speed, but not on intelligence of memory. Three patients deteriorated, eleven remained stable and sixteen showed significant improvement on psychological tests, mainly those for attention, motor speed and memory, but rarely did any improvement of intelligence occur.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?", "context": "The human phospholamban Arg14-deletion mutant localizes to plasma membrane and interacts with the Na/K-ATPase. Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), n this review, we attempted to highlight the functional significance of PLN in vertebrate cardiac physiology. We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains These results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions. Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through intramembrane interactions. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive). These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a. SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site in SERCA. However, in a ternary complex, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. . Conversely, using anti-SERCA2a antibody, both PLN and acylphosphatase were co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a, and the PLN amount in the precipitate decreased with increasing acylphosphatase concentrations.

Phospholamban (PLN) reversibly inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) through a direct protein-protein interaction, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in heart muscle cells. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?", "context": "RIP regulates signaling pathways by abrogating or releasing signaling molecules. Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, γ-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, γ-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes. In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury Along with β-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid β-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid β-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, γ-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that γ-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure High physiological concentrations of Aβ monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks γ-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes. Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize γ-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-à-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration. Aggregated forms of Aβ have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the Aβ levels by inhibiting γ-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of γ-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch. Nicastrin (Nct) is part of the γ-secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Was modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?", "context": "Modafinil improves antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism but not excessive daytime sleepiness, psychiatric symptoms or cognition in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that modafinil was a safe adjunctive treatment which improved parkinsonian symptoms and signs in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions, with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements. Emotional processing also appears to be enhanced by the drug, although to date there are only a limited number of studies. BACKGROUND: Modafinil, a putative cognitive enhancing drug, has previously been shown to improve performance of healthy volunteers as well as patients with attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, mainly in tests of executive functions.  A review of modafinil and armodafinil as add-on therapy in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. It has been suggested that modafinil and its isomer armodafinil as an add-on strategy to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia may improve cognitive functioning, attenuate fatigue, inactiveness and other negative functions as well as weight gain. Evidence for the use of modafinil or armodafinil as add-on therapy to antipsychotic drugs to alleviate fatigue, sleepiness and inactivity is inconclusive. One cohort study and one out of two single-dose crossover RCTs in which modafinil addition was studied could demonstrate a positive effect. All five RCTs of modafinil (three RCTs) and armodafinil (two RCTs) addition with a longer study duration could not demonstrate a positive effect.  In RCTs with a treatment duration of 4 weeks or more, however, no positive effect could be demonstrated on cognitive functioning with modafinil and armodafinil addition. Yet, four single-dose crossover RCTs of modafinil addition show significant positive effects on executive functioning, verbal memory span, visual memory, working memory, spatial planning, slowing in latency, impulse control and recognition of faces expressing sadness and sadness misattribution in the context of disgust recognition. The addition of modafinil or armodafinil to an antipsychotic regime, despite theoretical and preclinical considerations, has not been proved to enhance cognitive function, attenuate fatigue, enhance activity, improve negative symptoms and reduce weight in patients with schizophrenia. RATIONAL: In recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  CONCLUSION: The present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve attention, memory and executive function in the healthy population and in patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to counteract increased weight and metabolic diseases in patients taking clozapine. Modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve emotion discrimination in healthy individuals and attention and executive function in schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: These data support clinical evidence that modafinil may alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and also demonstrate the benefit of applying PLSR modeling to characterize functional brain networks in translational models relevant to central nervous system dysfunction. Modafinil improves working memory in healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, though the effects of modafinil have not been evaluated on working memory in methamphetamine-dependent subjects. Modafinil is a psychostimulant approved for treating excessive sleepiness in adults; off-label uses (e.g., treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, ADHD and age-related dementias) are currently being explored.  CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to treat negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, or wakefulness/fatigue in patients on clozapine. We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this quantity of movement can be increased by modafinil.  OBJECTIVE: Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.  RESULTS: One of 4 reviewed studies found a significant effect of modafinil as an alerting agent for antipsychotic-induced fatigue and sedation. Neither of 2 reviewed studies found modafinil to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Three of 6 reviewed studies showed that modafinil may improve short-term memory, attention, and the ability to shift mental sets.  CONCLUSIONS: While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.  Hence, before prescribing modafinil to a schizophrenia patient, the possible risks and benefits of each particular case should be evaluated. Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo. RATIONALE: The wake-promoting agent modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in schizophrenia.  Recently, however, modafinil has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. There is increasing interest in the use of modafinil to improve cognition in schizophrenia as well as in other disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Initial findings indicate that modafinil may lead to better executive functioning and attentional performance in patients with schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect on negative symptoms was found, adjunctive therapy with modafinil may result in global improvements in patients with schizophrenia who have prominent negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil did not improve cognitive control in all schizophrenia patients. . These data suggest that modafinil increases quantifiable motor behaviour in schizophrenia and may have an impact on avolition. One patient was on treatment with both modafinil and trazodone and reported no change after tapering each in separate discontinuation trials, while another 3 patients were taking sleeping medications and also noted no change after discontinuation.  Neuroprotective agents as add-on therapies (e.g., modafinil, erythropoietin, glycine, D-serine, memantine and celecoxib) are currently being evaluated in schizophrenia and related disorders.  In the modafinil (N = 10) and placebo (N = 10) groups, fatigue improved significantly over time (p < .01), but there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, positive and negative symptoms, or cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil modulates anterior cingulate cortex function in chronic schizophrenia but its beneficial cognitive effects may be restricted to a subset of patients requiring further characterisation. Modafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition, with 64% and 82% of patients rated as clinically improved at week 4 by a blinded clinician and the investigator respectively. Modafinil significantly improved fatigue (P = 0.025, week 3) and tended to improve cognitive functioning scores.  Although preliminary, these results suggest modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct treatment that improves global functioning and clinical condition, and reduces fatigue in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Modafinil had some cognitive enhancing properties in schizophrenia similar to those observed in healthy adults and adult patients with ADHD.  Modafinil may have potential as an important therapy for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on attentional set shifting. While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.

At all follow-ups, depressed low-grade glioma patients had a significantly shorter survival time, 3.3-5.8 years, compared to non-depressed low-grade glioma patients, 10.0-11.7 years. The results suggest that depression and decreased QOL among low-grade glioma patients is related to shorter survival at long-term follow-up. The adverse impact of depression in relation to survival among cancer patients is currently a subject of great interest in research. In the subgroup of patients with low-grade gliomas, depressive patients had a significantly shorter survival time compared with nondepressive subjects (P = 0.031, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis).

{"question": "Have germline variants been associated to colorectal cancer?", "context": "Overall, we identified aberrant transcripts in 8% of the patients (familial cases 30%; early-onset manifestation 21%). In eight of them, two different out-of-frame pseudoexons were found consisting of a 167-bp insertion from intron 4 in five families with a shared founder haplotype and a 83-bp insertion from intron 10 in three patients. The pseudoexon formation was caused by three different heterozygous germline mutations, which are supposed to activate cryptic splice sites We apply OS-Seq to resequence the exons of either 10 or 344 cancer genes from human DNA samples. In our assessment of capture performance, >87% of the captured sequence originated from the intended target region with sequencing coverage falling within a tenfold range for a majority of all targets. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) called from OS-Seq data agreed with >95% of variants obtained from whole-genome sequencing of the same individual. The minor alleles of CD44 rs8193 C>T, ALCAM rs1157 G>A, and LGR5 rs17109924 T>C were significantly associated with increased TTR (9.4 vs. 5.4 years; HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.35-0.93; P = 0.022; 11.3 vs. 5.7 years; HR, 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.94; P = 0.024, and 10.7 vs. 5.7 years; HR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12-0.90; P = 0.023, respectively) and remained significant in the multivariate analysis stratified by ethnicity. In recursive partitioning, a specific gene variant profile including LGR5 rs17109924, CD44 rs8193, and ALDH1A1 rs1342024 represented a high-risk subgroup with a median TTR of 1.7 years (HR, 6.71, 95% CI: 2.71-16.63, P < 0.001). In this study, we identified common germline variants in VEGF-dependent and -independent angiogenesis genes predicting clinical outcome and tumor response in patients with mCRC receiving first-line bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. We identified 22 nonsynonymous somatic mutations of which the majority was of missense type. In germline, three novel nonsynonymous variants were identified in the following genes: CSMD3, EPHB6 and C10orf137, and none of the variants were present in 890 population-matched healthy controls. It is possible that the identified germline variants modulate predisposition to CRC. One patient proved to carry an APC whole-gene deletion; 4 of 25 (16%) patients showed biallelic and 3 of 25 (12%) monoallelic MUTYH mutations. In the three heterozygous subjects no pathogenetic variants were found in OGG1, MTH1, APE1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes. Frequency assessment of MUTYH mutations in healthy subjects showed that only Y165C and G382D reach a subpolymorphic frequency. Scrutinizing the molecular genetic results and family data of 242 index patients with pathogenic APC mutations led to the identification of 10 mosaic cases (4%). C>T transitions were observed in CGA sites in four of the 10 cases with somatic mosaicism, which is significantly more than 26 of the 232 non-mosaic cases (p = 0.02). Phenotypes of patients with somatic mosaicism ranged from an attenuated form of polyposis coli to florid polyposis with major extracolonic manifestations. Altogether 12 previously reported changes and four novel genetic alterations, mostly in intronic sequences, were identified. The results revealed the presence of biallelic germline MYH mutations in two patients. These patients were compound heterozygotes for two of the most common germline mutations c.494 A>G (p.Y165C); c.1,145 G>A (p.G382D).

TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected.

{"question": "Does nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?", "context": "Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced the expression of synaptogamin and syntaxin and blocked the suppressive effect of vecuronium, suggesting that both agents inhibit presynaptic L-type calcium channels. Treatment with nifedipine to inhibit calcium influx via the L-type channel Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) inhibited the TGFbeta stimulated increase in ANK expression at all phases of chondrogenesis. Finally, we found that PKCepsilon-induced stellation was significantly reduced by the specific L-type channel blocker nifedipine, indicating that calcium influx through VGCC mediates the change in astrocyte morphology induced by PKCepsilon. However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol. Both the metallic ions Cd2+ and Ni2+, known to inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels and T-type channels, respectively, and verapamil and nifedipine, typical blocker of L-type calcium channels completely prevented the hypoxic neuronal NO generation. Further, the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, was able to inhibit the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that at least this phase of the TMT effect was mediated by calcium channels, although nifedipine had no significant effect on the time to reach the maximal [Ca2+]i level Treatment with omega-conotoxin GVIA (3 microM) or nifedipine (10 microM) to inhibit Ca(2+) influx through N- or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), respectively, also decreased the rate of AP repolarization and increased AP duration Concentrations of nifedipine (10 microM) and nimodipine (3 microM) that maximally inhibit L-type calcium channels reduced the sI(AHP) by 30 and 50%, respectively Consequently, it was demonstrated in the present study that nimodipine and nitrendipine inhibit both L- and N-type calcium channels and thus seem to be unique among the dihydropyridines examined in their effects on calcium channels in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG 108-15 cells, whereas nifedipine and niguldipine appear to block mainly L-type calcium channels However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol Calcium-channel antagonists, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx GVIA; N-type), nifedipine (L-type), and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CmTx MVIIC; P/Q type), were used to characterize the voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs) involved in this release The T- and L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) mibefradil attenuates leg edema induced by the L-type CCB nifedipine in the spontaneously hypertensive rat: a novel differentiating assay.

{"question": "Is there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?", "context": "These central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia. The Effect of TRH to correct the abnormal F responses in SSP might be consistent with effects of TRH to reduce spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis described previously Agents undergoing therapeutic trials at present include CNTF, IGF1 glutamate antagonists, branched-chain amino acids and TRH analogue. Evidence that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has prominent trophic effects on the motor system led to several negative therapeutic trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease of the motor system. The results of the clinical evaluation at the beginning and end of the treatment as well as after patient follow up demonstrated that beneficial effects do not occur equally in all patients but rather are transitory and do not improve the natural evolution of the disease. The neurological evaluation after acute TRH-T treatment showed an objective improvement in 3 of the 8. The outcome of the study, in agreement with some and at variance with other studies, was that TRH induced a statistically significant neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 ALS patients but little or none in the other ALS patients and in patients with other neurological diseases. [A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disturbance of vertical ocular movement responding to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)]. TRH injections resulted in improvement of disturbance of vertical ocular movement, but no effect was seen on the weakness of the limb. 13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were treated with intravenous infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).  Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively.  No clinical improvement was detected.  A trial of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) 5.0 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously every other day for two weeks produced transient increased tone in muscles, along with other (side-) effects in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Although the mechanism is not known, several reports of the effectiveness of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in ALS were recently published. Protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Clinical studies have shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, it depends on whether the patient has bulbar or nonbulbar signs and is male or female. Future studies must take into consideration this state dependence as a specific feature of the pharmacological action of TRH and its analogues. Three of the studies showed a transient, statistically significant effect in at least some muscles. The two studies that demonstrated no such effect both used TRH in very small doses. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the effect of TRH in ALS is a definite, acute, and transient response.  It was found that in only 3 out of 14 patients with moderately progressed disease no improvement was achieved, while in 11 cases the improvement was from 10 to 20%. However, the improvement was transient, and TRH treatment failed to stop the progression of the disease. Only 3 patients noted subjective improvement of strength. In 6 of the 9, TRH induced a significant increase in vibratory inhibition. This suggests that the TRH-induced reduction of spasticity might be due to an increase in presynaptic inhibition acting on Ia fibres. However, 2 mg DN-1417, IM twice a day for 1 month in an open-label trial, produced no objective improvement of strength in nine patients with ALS.  Our experience suggests that this approach is safe, has high patient acceptance, and is worthy of more careful evaluation. Focal, small-to-moderate and transient improvement occurred in the muscle strength and function of patients with ALS who received TRH in dose-response and screening studies. In a small pilot study of 12 patients, 3 months administration of TRH at 10 mg per kg on alternate days resulted in localized increased strength of jaw muscles as well as significant improvement in lower extremity function. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH.  Mild to moderate improvement was found in 9 (56%) of 16 patients.  We thought such action of TRH to be useful to the therapy of ALS. With daily TRH, 10 patients noted subjective improvement without objective evidence, and 10 patients complained of worsening of the disease with objective decline after TRH was stopped. Statistical analysis, however, showed no beneficial effects from either acute or chronic TRH trials. A temporary increase in the strength of some muscles was detected following the administration of TRH, but no change in functional performance was noted. Neither the patients nor the investigators believed the effects were of any marked clinical significance. Nevertheless, statistically significant improvement was seen only in dynametric strength 1 hour after subcutaneous injection (p less than 0.05). Significant improvement occurred, in one patient only, on subjective speech testing during IV infusion of TRH. In none of six other ratings was there a significant difference between TRH and placebo. Subjective improvement was noted by 11 of 12 patients. Significant improvement, as shown by statistical analysis, was noted in muscle strength in the 9 patients by 5 infusions over a 4-week period and a sub-group of 5 patients treated by 8 infusions over 10 weeks. The progressive course of this disease, manifested by increasing atrophy, paralysis and disability score, was not altered.  Very high intravenous doses (2-19 mg/min) of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide) given to 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) produced a moderate to marked improvement of functions caused by deficiency of lower motor neurons (weakness) and upper motor neurons (spasticity).

{"question": "Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?", "context": "A phase I trial of vertical inhibition of IGF signalling using cixutumumab, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, and selumetinib, an MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumours. BACKGROUND: We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of>6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition. MHC class I loss is a frequent mechanism of immune escape in papillary thyroid cancer that is reversed by interferon and selumetinib treatment in vitro. Increased antigenicity following selumetinib and IFN treatment warrants further study for immunotherapy of progressive PTC. The role of KIs in differentiated TC may be revolutionised by the finding that selumetinib may restore a clinical response to radioactive iodine (RAI).  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.  Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of motor neurons (MN) in the spinal cord, and is associated with local neuroinflammation. T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease.  Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. The immune system has been found to be involved with positive and negative effects in the nervous system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In general, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, antibodies, complement and cytokines participate in limiting damage. Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes.

{"question": "Could Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?", "context": "The use of HIPEC after aggressive cytoreductive surgery in patients with ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity rates. Knowledge of the factors associated with the onset of these postoperative adverse events allows better management of the same and offers the patient a safe procedure These results showed that the association of HIPEC with a complete cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer presents acceptable morbidity and survival There is level-one evidence suggesting the benefit of postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, albeit catheter-related complications resulted after treatment discontinuation. Studies report the use of HIPEC predominantly in the setting of recurrent disease and have demonstrated encouraging results, which merits further investigation in future clinical trials  The combination of SCR and HIPEC seems to improve survival rate in patients suffering from platinum-sensitive EOC recurrence with respect to no-HIPEC treatments. This result further supports the need of a randomized trial  Cautious extrapolation of data from standard normothermic, nonintraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and data from Phase II and nonrandomized comparative studies suggest that HIPEC delivered at the time of surgery for ovarian cancer has definite potential The available evidence suggests that a potential survival benefit of adding HIPEC may be largest in the settings of secondary CRS for stage III ovarian cancer and salvage CRS for recurrent ovarian cancer, two time-points representing failure of initial standard therapy. There is much less evidence for a potential benefit of HIPEC for less advanced stages (I-II) and for earlier time-points in the treatment of ovarian cancer (upfront, interval and consolidation) Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer Patients suffering from peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer should be considered for radical reoperation with HIPEC in a center with expertise in multimodal therapeutic options. Organ-preserving cytoreductive surgery allows complete cytoreduction with the goal of decreasing morbidity  In recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients, the use of CRS plus HIPEC represents a safe treatment, able to significantly influence the survival rates compared to chemotherapy alone or surgery plus standard chemotherapy  The results of our study indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of a protocol including systemic chemotherapy, surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer. A phase III trial to compare this approach with conventional treatment is needed In selected patients with heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer, cytoreduction combined with HIPEC may provide a meaningful OS with acceptable morbidity. Optimal results are achieved in patients with a macroscopically complete resection and biologically favorable disease  HIPEC is a complement to radical surgery/ peritonectomy, which has been shown to be a surgical procedure with high tolerability, low morbimortality, enhanced survival and prolonged disease-free interval in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent ovarian cancer  Despite the heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, current evidence suggest that complete CRS and HIPEC may be a feasible option with potential benefits that are comparable with the current standard of care. A randomized trial is required to establish the role of HIPEC in ovarian cancer in the majority of patients with primary and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with HIPEC can lead to a substantial increase in subsequent rates of disease-free and overall survival  Peritonectomy procedures combined with HIPEC offer promising long-term survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis.

{"question": "Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?", "context": "In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells. These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling. These data suggest that P-Rex1 has an influence on physiological migratory processes, such as invasion of cancer cells, both through effects upon classical Rac1-driven motility and a novel association with RTK signalling complexes. Activated PAR1 induced RhoA and Rac1 phosphorylation, and subsequent overexpression of myosin IIA and filamin B which are stress fiber components that were identified by PMF analysis of peptide mass data obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS measurement.  These results demonstrate that PAR1 activation induces cell morphological change associated with cell motility via Rho family activation and cytoskeletal protein overexpression, and has a critical role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Rac1 was found to be required for actopaxin-induced matrix degradation whereas inhibition of myosin contractility promoted degradation in the phosphomutant-expressing Quint cells, indicating that a balance of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation of cellular tension are important for the process. Taken together, this study demonstrates a new role for actopaxin phosphorylation in matrix degradation and cell invasion via regulation of Rho GTPase signaling. BART inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion by Rac1 inactivation through direct binding to active Rac1 We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1. The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART. Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion. It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. Targeted down-regulation of RhoC led to sustained activation of Rac1 GTPase and morphological, molecular and phenotypic changes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis. Finally, Rac1 leads to β1 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rac1 (T17N) could largely block EGF-induced PI3K/Akt-PAK1 activation and cell migration. Our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signalling events, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1. Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. The suppression of MMP-2 expression by CTXG led to an inhibition of SW620 cells invasion and migration by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CTXG exerted anti-invasion action in SW620 cells by targeting MMP-2 though regulating the activities of Rac1, Cdc42 and their downstream transcriptional factor AP-1. ctivation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells. At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP.  These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug. RhoGDI2 modulates the invasiveness and metastatic ability of cancer cells through regulation of Rac1 activity. We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity. LMO1 and Dock180, a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promote human glioma cell invasion Here, we report for the first time that engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180), a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), are evidently linked to the invasive phenotype of glioma cells. Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation. Members of the Rac family of small GTPases are known to act as regulators of actin cytoskeletal structures and strongly influence the cellular processes of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Even though hyperactivated Rac proteins have been shown to influence metastatic processes, these proteins have never been directly linked to metastatic progression.  We show that increased activation of Rac proteins directly correlates with increasing metastatic potential in a panel of cell variants derived from a single metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435). Expression of a dominant active Rac1 or a dominant active Rac3 resulted in a more invasive and motile phenotype. Moreover, expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 into the most metastatic cell variant resulted in decreased invasive and motile properties. This study correlates endogenous Rac activity with high metastatic potential and implicates Rac in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is the gene SLC6A2 associated with orthostatic intolerance?", "context": "Orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture. The norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) has been implicated in a genetic form of the disorder.  Thus attenuated baroreflex function and reduced sympathetic outflow may contribute to the orthostatic intolerance of severe NET deficiency. A mutation in the human norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associated with orthostatic intolerance disrupts surface expression of mutant and wild-type transporters.  Recently, our laboratory reported a polymorphism in the human NET (hNET) gene A457P in an individual with the autonomic disorder orthostatic intolerance (OI).  Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human NET (hNET) gene that influence transporter function can contribute to disease, such as the nonfunctional transporter, A457P, identified in orthostatic intolerance.  Orthostatic intolerance is not necessarily related to a specific mutation (Ala457Pro) in the human norepinephrine transporter gene. We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS. In the absence of altered SLC6A2 gene sequence or promoter methylation, this reduced expression was directly correlated with chromatin modifications.

Macitentan (Opsumit®) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting. Selection of macitentan was based on inhibitory potency on both ET receptors and optimization of physicochemical properties to achieve high affinity for lipophilic milieu. In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577.  Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors). In rats with pulmonary hypertension, macitentan prevented both the increase of pulmonary pressure and the right ventricle hypertrophy, and it markedly improved survival.  In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats. This profile makes macitentan a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation.

As CHEK2 is a cell-cycle master controller, we tested the hypothesis that heterozygosity for the frameshift alteration CHEK2*1100delC is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma. In the current study, we evaluated the possible associations of seven common variants of the DNA repair and cell cycle control genes BRCA2 and CHEK2 with malignant melanoma (MM). Promotor methylation analysis of key regulatory genes involved in cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2), DNA repair (hMLH1), apoptosis (p73, survivin, DAPK), and differentiation (RARb, WT1) was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. CHEK2 is a key cell cycle control gene encoding a pluripotent kinase that can cause arrest or apoptosis in response to unrepaired DNA damage. High-fidelity maintenance of genomic integrity in eukaryotes is ensured by cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. The checkpoint kinase, Chk2, has been implicated in both of these responses. In response to DNA damage, Chk2 is initially phosphorylated at Thr-68, which leads to its full activation. The fully activated Chk2 then phosphorylates downstream substrates of cell cycle control.

This suggests that the endogenous enhancer activity of ∼30% of human CNEs can be determined from experiments in zebra fish If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes. Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes. Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers. The genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers. , we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation.

{"question": "Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?", "context": "This testing is used for identifying singlegene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial disorders, gender selection in non-mendelian disorders with unequal gender distribution, aneuploidy screening, and other preconceptually identified genetic abnormalities in prospective parents.   Although many clinics offer PGD for HA by gender selection, an approach that detects the presence of the underlying F8 mutation has several advantages.  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for gender selection for non-medical reasons has been considered an unethical procedure by several authors and agencies in the Western society on the basis that it could disrupt the sex ratio, that it discriminates against women and that it leads to disposal of normal embryos of the non-desired gender. In this study, the analysis of a large series of PGD procedures for gender selection from a wide geographical area in the USA shows that, in general, there is no deviation in preference towards any specific gender except for a preference of males in some ethnic populations of Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern origin that represent a small percentage of the US population.   In response to one specific question, one-third of the couples agreed to use the donor child as a lifetime organ donor and supported the use of PGD for non-medical gender selection.  More specifically, I illustrate how the prescriptions of deliberative democracy can be applied to the issue of regulating non-medical uses of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), such as gender selection.  Private clinics were more likely than other programs to be on either the East or West Coast, list certain PGD risks (e.g., diagnostic error), note that PGD was new or controversial, reference source of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons. The purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure. Performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. One possible use of PGD is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow Mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence). Here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering PGD gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-Mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  New uses of PGD have been reported in the past year for screening embryos for susceptibility to cancer, for late-onset diseases, for HLA-matching for existing children, and for gender.  This article describes current and likely future uses of PGD, and then analyses the ethical issues posed by new uses of PGD to screen embryos for susceptibility and late-onset conditions, for HLA-matching for tissue donation to an existing child, and for gender selection. The use of PGD for sex selection arouses considerable debate, especially in countries like India that have a marked cultural preference for boys. It is argued that using PGD for sex selection is a treatment option that can be ethically offered to couples who desire to use this technology to plan their families.

Few monogenic mutations causing human male infertility have been identified to date.  We studied pubertal development and fecundity in males with Mulibrey nanism (MUL) caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene.  Mulibrey nanism is a rare growth disorder of prenatal onset caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene, which encodes a RING-B-box-coiled-coil protein. The pathogenetic mechanisms of mulibrey nanism are unknown.  Mulibrey nanism is an autosomal recessive growth disorder caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding a protein of unknown function.

{"question": "Is there any protein that undergoes both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination?", "context": "The yeast G protein alpha subunit Gpa1 represents a rare example of a protein that undergoes both mono- and poly-ubiquitination.  Expression of p34 promotes PTEN poly-ubiquitination, leading to PTEN protein degradation, whereas p34 knockdown results in PTEN mono-ubiquitination. These fingers possess E3 activities of mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination, respectively, with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-binding capabilities.  Instead of promoting poly-ubiquitination and degradation, we show that Smurf2 actually induces multiple mono-ubiquitination of Smad3 in vivo. mono-ubiquitination of CIITA dramatically increases its transactivity whereas poly-ubiquitination leads to CIITA degradation. This leads to a model in which Lys134 of LDB1 can be either mono-ubiquitinated, leading to stabilization, or poly-ubiquitinated, leading to degradation by the proteasome pathway.   mono-ubiquitination of CIITA increases its transactivity, whereas poly-ubiquitination of CIITA leads to its degradation PS1 ubiquitination after PI3K inhibition is represented by the multiple mono-ubiquitination, instead of poly-ubiquitination Our observations support a novel functional relationship between parkin and Hsc/Hsp70 and support the notion that parkin is a multi-purpose E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of modifying proteins either via attachment of alternatively linked poly-ubiquitin chains or through multiple mono-ubiquitination to achieve alternate biological outcomes our results indicate that Hsp70 facilitates CHIP-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Smad1 whereas it attenuates CHIP-meditated mono-ubiquitination of Smad1. Whereas poly-ubiquitination targets protein substrates for proteasomal degradation, mono-ubiquitination is known to regulate protein trafficking in the endosomal system and to target cargo proteins for lysosomal degradation. Our results suggest that oxidative stress induces not only poly-ubiquitination but also mono-ubiquitination of LDH-A, which may be involved in its lysosomal degradation during unloading. wild type Smad4 is a relatively stable protein that undergoes mono- or oligo-ubiquitination, a modification not linked to protein degradation These data suggest that oligo-ubiquitination positively regulates Smad4 function, whereas poly-ubiquitination primarily occurs in unstable cancer mutants and leads to protein degradation. We found that Ro52 was strongly conjugated by a single molecule of ubiquitin in cells. Although the biological relevance of this mono-ubiquitination was not defined, the function of Ro52 might be modified by the mono-ubiquitination. We also found that Ro52 was conjugated with poly-ubiquitin chain in cells (poly-ubiquitination)", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?", "context": "We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.   In addition, phase III trials in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned, and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.  In a phase II study, researchers found that the PARP inhibitor olaparib led to stable disease or tumor regressions in patients with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers who had germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy.  The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively.  It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. Olaparib, one of the most studied PARPis, has demonstrated activity in BRCA1/2(MUT+) and BRCA-like sporadic ovarian and breast cancers, and looks promising in prostate and pancreatic cancers. Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index<0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. A phase II study of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (AstraZeneca) for cancer patients with inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations confirmed earlier results showing clinical benefit for advanced breast and ovarian cancers, and demonstrated evidence of effectiveness against pancreatic and prostate cancers.

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone. Collectively, cotreatment with HDACi and PARPi downregulated HR-related protein expression and concomitantly increased DNA damage, resulting in prostate cancer cell death.

In rice, most of these CpG clusters are associated with genes. Rice genes are grouped into one of the five classes according to the position of an associated CpG cluster. Among them, class 1 genes, which harbor a CpG cluster at the 5'-terminus, share similarities with human genes having CpG islands Segmental distribution of genes harboring a CpG island-like region on rice chromosomes Highly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genes Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of \"putative\" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants This study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of DNA curvature, CpG islands and tandem repeats at the DNA sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants.

{"question": "Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?", "context": "The use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for noninvasive respiratory support of very preterm infants (gestational age, <32 weeks) after extubation. The use of high-flow nasal cannulae was noninferior to the use of nasal CPAP, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the nasal-cannulae group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the CPAP group (risk difference, 8.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 18.7).  Although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of CPAP as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation.  Recently high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is emerging as an efficient, better tolerated form of NIV, allowing better access to the baby's face, which may improve nursing, feeding and bonding. In conclusion, there is a growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative mode of NIV.  HHHFNC and NCPAP produced similar rates of extubation failure. The use of HFNC as a respiratory support modality is increasing in the infant, pediatric, and adult populations as an alternative to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Current evidence suggests that HFNC is well tolerated and may be feasible in a subset of patients who require ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation. Heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HHHFNC) has been used to improve ventilation in preterm infants.  Increasing flow rates of HHHFNC therapy are associated with linear increases in NP pressures in bronchiolitis patients.  An alternative to the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) as a non-invasive modality to support respiratory distress in premature infants has been the recent introduction of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices in many neonatal units. There has been increased use of HFNC presumably because of anecdotal reports and experience that it is easy to use, and well tolerated by the infants, while experiencing decreased nasal septumerosion. High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are gaining in popularity as a form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units around the world. HFNC may be as effective as NCPAP at improving respiratory parameters such as tidal volume and work of breathing in preterm infants, but probably only at flow rates >2 litres/min.  There is growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative to other forms of non-invasive ventilation in preterm infants.  When used as primary respiratory support after birth, one trial found similar rates of treatment failure in infants treated with HFNC and nasal CPAP. Following extubation, one trial found that infants treated with HFNC had a significantly higher rate of reintubation than those treated with nasal CPAP. Another trial found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified HFNC, and the fourth trial found no difference between two different models of equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC.  When used following extubation, HFNC may be associated with a higher rate of reintubation than nasal CPAP.  Early weaning from CPAP to high flow nasal cannula in preterm infants is associated with prolonged oxygen requirement: a randomized controlled trial. After randomization, the no-NC group had fewer days on oxygen [median (interquartile range): 5 (1-8) vs 14 (7.5-19.25) days, p<0.001] and shorter duration of respiratory support [10.5 (4-21) vs 18 (11.5-29) days, p=0.03]. There were no differences between groups regarding success of weaning from NCPAP.  Weaning preterm infants from NCPAP to NC is associated with increased exposure to oxygen and longer duration of respiratory support.

The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented β-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. Nonetheless, the insulin secretion is sensibly augmented after T3 stimulation. Plasma glucose concentration of the fetal hypothyroid group during intravenous glucose tolerance test was significantly higher (p=0.003) at 5-20 min as compared to the control group, whereas plasma insulin concentration was significantly lower (p=0.012) at 5-20 min Although adult offspring born from hypothyroid mothers were euthyroid, their glucose tolerance and glucose stimulated insulin secretion of islets were altered hyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion Only T(3) concentrations higher than 250 microM were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of apoptosis and to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. Islets preincubated with glucose (3.3 mmol/l) and glucagon (1.4 mumol/l) plus theophylline (10 mmol/l), ACTH (0.11 nmol/l), bovine GH (0.46 mumol/l), prolactin (0.2 mumol/l) or tri-iodothyronine (1.0 nmol/l) have significantly lower Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than those preincubated with only 3.3 mmol glucose/l. All these hormones increased the release of insulin significantly. T3 (0.2 nM) did not affect insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose or in the presence of secretagogues (potassium and glyceraldehyde). In the perfused rat pancreas, the addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose.

{"question": "Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?", "context": "A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function. In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced. The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. AAV-mediated knock-down of HRC exacerbates transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy Ablation of HRC showed relatively normal phenotypes under basal condition, but exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy Our results present evidence that down-regulation of HRC could deteriorate cardiac function in TAC-FH through perturbed SR-mediated Ca(2+) cycling However, AAV9-mediated HRC-KD in TAC-FH was associated with decreased fractional shortening and increased cardiac fibrosis compared with control. Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates. The exaggerated response of HRC knockout mice to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is consistent with a regulatory role for HRCBP in calcium handling in vivo and suggests that mutations in HRC, in combination with other genetic or environmental factors, might contribute to pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure. Collectively, these data indicate that alterations in expression levels of HRC are associated with impaired cardiac SR Ca homeostasis and contractile function.

We present the case of a 20-year-old male with a clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme and multiple adenomatous colonic polyps.  Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare hereditary disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the colon and the central nervous system (CNS). Here we present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a synchronous clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and colonic adenocarcinoma. Based on this case study, the synchronous presentation of glioblastoma multiforme and adenocarcinoma of the colon might suggest a shorter survival rate for patients with Turcot syndrome.  A 15-year-old boy was admitted with the diagnosis of colonic polyposis, and during a 2-year follow-up, he underwent operation for right parieto-occipital anaplastic astrocytoma, left-side colonic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and cerebella glioblastoma which were all confirmed by histology. Although cases of Turcot's syndrome (TS) (colonic polyposis and primary brain tumour occurring in the same patient) have been previously described, association with haematological malignancy is rare.

Glioblastomas with giant cell and sarcomatous features in patients with Turcot syndrome type 1: a clinicopathological study of 3 cases. Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder of DNA mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (GBM) in the type 1 variant.  We report the clinicopathological and genetic features of 3 gliomas in TS type 1 patients. We conclude that 1) the giant cell variant of GBM is overrepresented in TS; 2) gliosarcomas may also be encountered; and 3) survival is often favorable, despite histological anaplasia and exuberant proliferation. Malignant transformation of high-grade astrocytoma associated with neurocysticercosis in a patient with Turcot syndrome. A 45-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma was clinically diagnosed with Turcot syndrome, and subsequently developed simultaneous neurocysticercosis and malignant transformation to glioblastoma.  Familial glioblastoma multiforme is a rather uncommon entity, being in most cases associated to known genetic disorders (as Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, etc.).  Turcot syndrome (MIM276300) has been described as the association of central nervous system malignant tumors and familial colorectal cancer and has been reported to be both a dominant and recessive disorder. We report here the first identification of a homozygous mutation in MSH6 in a family with childhood-onset brain tumor, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotype.  Of the 21 patients, 12 have died (10 after relapse, with a median time to progression for the whole series of 14 months; one with intratumoral bleeding at 40 months after diagnosis; and one affected by Turcot syndrome for duodenal cancer relapse). [Glioblastoma multiforme as a manifestation of Turcot syndrome]. In the present case, a 60-year-old patient with glioblastoma multiforme and a history of hereditary malignomas is described as an example of a HNPCC-associated Turcot's syndrome. Computed tomography brain scan and computed tomography-guided biopsy revealed a left frontoparietal glioblastoma multiforme. This case illustrates the rare presentation of Turcot syndrome-a hereditary colorectal polyposis syndrome-in an older adult. Turcot syndrome is the association of colorectal polyposis with primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.  Brain tumor is mainly diagnosed as glioblastoma or astrocytoma and mismatch repair genes might be involved.  Patients with Turcot syndrome (TS) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. The authors describe a patient with TS featuring a known germline mutation of exon 5 of the hPMS2 mismatch repair gene who developed two metachronous glioblastomas, both with distinct oligodendroglial features. Because this patient had an unusual underlying condition and his tumor had a unique histological appearance for TS, it was hypothesized that this genetic defect may predispose to malignant gliomas with oligodendroglial features.  Turcot Syndrome caused by APC gene develops medulloblastoma and Turcot Syndrome caused by mismatch repair gene develops glioblastoma.  It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms and gastrointestinal polyposis. Seven months after resection of this Dukes' C2 adenocarcinoma, she presented with a second primary CNS tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. The Turcot syndrome has been defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple polyposis of the colon and a malignant brain tumor. The case of a 47-year-old man submitted to a right hemicolectomy for cancer and polyposis, following a series of endoscopic polypectomies and, finally, removal of left temporal glioma is here presented.  Two of 13 showed microsatellite instability, one of which in a patient with Turcot syndrome, the other in gliomatosis cerebri. The Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare, probably autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by development of primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps.  However, no somatic mutations in APC were found among 91 neuroepithelial tumors (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma), whether sporadic or associated with TS.  Such syndromes include neurofibromatosis type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Turcot syndrome.  This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli.  The authors describe two patients with the association of polyposis-coli and central nervous system tumor (Turcot's syndrome).  We report a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 20-year old man with multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and glioblastoma multiforme.  Another unusual autopsy case of the Turcot syndrome is reported in a 23-year-old woman with polyposis coli, who developed primary carcinoma of the jejunum and glioblastoma multiforme of the left frontal lobe.

Surgery remains the elective treatment. We retrospectively compared two group of patients, who underwent surgery for GIST before and after Imatinib advent in order to analyze the recurrence and survival rate. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs R1 surgery (versus R0) alone is not an indication for adjuvant imatinib in low-risk GIST. Treatment is not recommended in an imatinib-insensitive D842V-mutated GIST Prognostic factors such as tumor size, mitotic rate and presence of metastases may provide an indication for adjuvant imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment. Here we present a young patient with a large GIST with high-risk features who is in complete remission after surgical excision and adjuvant IM treatment. This patient is the only colon-located CD117-positive case where IM was administered. Imatinib mesylate is the sole BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as first-line treatment of accelerated-phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). imatinib mesylate could be a therapeutic target of strategies against osteosarcoma tumors. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well-established as a potentially curative treatment for patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia. The success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as initial therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for this disease. Imatinib plus hydroxyurea is well tolerated among patients with meningioma but has modest anti-tumor activity for this indication. Ki67 correlated with time to recurrence (p=0.022). Ki67 >11% was taken as the indication to start imatinib chemotherapy (sensitivity 61.5%, specificity 92.0%, p=0.022). Significant pharmacokinetic interactions have already been shown between St. John's Wort (SJW) and the anticancer drugs imatinib and irinotecan. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The drugs were assessed according to clinical evidence on efficacy and safety, based on Micromedex categorization, on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Indications present in the legal documentation were compared to the indications approved by regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Bevacizumab, capecitabine, cetuximab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib, and temozolomide Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed resistance to death activated by spindle defects, reversed by imatinib. Imatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST. Surgical indication for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treated with imatinib is not yet established. Surgery of residual disease upon best clinical response seems associated with survival benefit compared with historical controls in similar patient collectives treated with imatinib alone.

{"question": "Is the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?", "context": "miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of key neuronal microRNAs-including mir-9/9*, mir-124 and mir-132-is repressed in the brains of human HD patients and mouse models. To determine if production of miR-132 is regulated by neuronal activity its expression in mouse brain was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Expression levels of primary and mature-miR-132 increased significantly between postnatal Days 10 and 24. We conclude that miR-132 is an activity-dependent microRNA in vivo, and may contribute to the long-lasting proteomic changes required for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. We investigated how prior seizure preconditioning affects the miRNA response to status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid in mice. Increased miR-132 levels were matched with increased binding to Argonaute-2, a constituent of the RNA-induced silencing complex. In tolerant animals, expression responses of >40% of the injury-group-detected miRNAs differed, being either unchanged relative to control or down-regulated, and this included miR-132. In vivo microinjection of locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides (antagomirs) against miR-132 depleted hippocampal miR-132 levels and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death. Thus, our data strongly suggest that miRNAs are important regulators of seizure-induced neuronal death. Preconditioning describes the ischemic stimulus that triggers an endogenous, neuroprotective response that protects the brain during a subsequent severe ischemic injury, a phenomenon known as 'tolerance'. Downregulation of miR-132 is consistent with our finding that preconditioning ischemia induces a rapid increase in MeCP2 protein, but not mRNA, in mouse cortex. These studies reveal that ischemic preconditioning regulates expression of miRNAs and their predicted targets in mouse brain cortex, and further suggest that miRNAs and MeCP2 could serve as effectors of ischemic preconditioning-induced tolerance. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. transgenic HD mice have abnormal miRNA biogenesis. This information should aid in future studies on therapeutic application of miRNAs in HD. miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. reports of microRNA (miR) modulators of both neuronal and immune processes (here termed NeurimmiRs) predict therapeutic potential for manipulating NeurimmiR levels in diseases affecting both the immune system and higher brain functions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and anxiety-related disorders.

{"question": "Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?", "context": "Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development. Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL).  Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers.  The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL. Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).  Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by aberrant activation of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL cases. The high prevalence of activating NOTCH1 mutations highlights the critical role of NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease and has prompted the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway.  Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling. Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients frequently display NOTCH1 activating mutations and Notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor PTEN. The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in over 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) has generated major interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation downstream of oncogenic NOTCH and in the targeting of the NOTCH signaling pathway in this disease. BACKGROUND: In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation. Activating mutations in NOTCH1 consitute the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC The Notch signaling pathway has been recognized as a key factor for the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), because of the high incidence of activating mutations of Notch1 Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Overall, these experiments point to a neurodegenerative but antiapoptotic effect of endogenous ghrelin in this model of global ischemia, highlighting that further research is essential before we can apply ghrelin treatments to neurodegenerative insults in the clinic.

RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin and ghrelin were confirmed in the stroke group. Ghrelin levels correlated mildly with triglyceride levels, and were dominant in men with cardioembolic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. Ghrelin suppresses inflammation and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in focal cerebral ischemia via the vagus nerve. Compared with vehicle treatment, human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats after MCAO showed marked reduction in neurological deficit by 57% and infarct size by 25%.  Human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats significantly decreased the above measurements. Human ghrelin treatment also improved 7-day survival and significantly decreased neurological deficit over the entire 7 days after MCAO in vagus nerve-intact rats compared with vehicle.  Human ghrelin is thus a neuroprotective agent that inhibits inflammation, nNOS activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway. Ghrelin is known to promote neuronal defense and survival against ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptotic processes.  Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway. In conclusion, it is considered that ghrelin as well as S-100B can be a useful marker for the prediction of stoke after CPB.

In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. This paper shows how reconfigurable architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We have constructed a linear systolic array to perform pairwise sequence distance computations using dynamic programming. This results in an implementation with significant runtime savings on a standard FPGA. in this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom instructions. We present a reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments.

{"question": "Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?", "context": "A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing ≥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by \"fail\" on otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening. 58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%) had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia failed screening. Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P = .03). Achondroplasia (MIM 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. The phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. This autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is G380R. The diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. Anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity. The report includes information on otitis media, ventilation tubes, hearing loss, tonsillectomy, speech problems, tibial bowing and osteotomy, ventricular shunting, apnoea, cervicomedullary decompression, and neurological signs attributable to spinal stenosis. We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children). There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults.

{"question": "Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?", "context": "High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. Concomitant intra-mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation. These events led to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The novel findings of the study reveal that high glucose induces apoptosis by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via concomitant rise in intracellular calcium. Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction has been attributed, in part, to calcium overload within individual myocytes. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that intracellular Ca2+ overload in cardiac myocytes leads to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. It seems that intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes.

BFNC syndrome exhibits genetic heterogeneity, as has been hypothesised to occur in Arabian foals, and is known to be caused by mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes. They also demonstrate that sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common IE syndromes. The underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in KCNQ2, a K(+) channel gene. Sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common idiopathic epilepsy syndromes. This paper summarizes recent findings concerning sodium (SCN1A) and potassium channel (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3) dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of rare and common idiopathic epilepsies (IE).  Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE).

Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end. here is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells. Influenza A virus transcribes its segmented negative sense RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells in a process long known to require host RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II). We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR).

Oncotype DX is a clinically validated, high-complexity, multianalyte reverse transcription-PCR genomic test that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in early-stage, node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  We therefore investigated the analytical performance of the assay. Assays used a pooled RNA sample from fixed paraffin-embedded tissues to evaluate the analytical performance of a 21-gene panel with respect to amplification efficiency, precision, linearity, and dynamic range, as well as limits of detection and quantification. One such strategy is the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX), which is currently in commercial use in the USA. One advantage of this test is the use of paraffin-embedded blocks instead of previous methods, which required fresh frozen tissue.  We used paraffin-embedded core biopsies from a completed phase II trial to identify genes that correlate with response to primary chemotherapy.

These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4 Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. HLA-DRB1 and the R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22 were genotyped In addition, evidence of a significant interaction between the shared epitope and the risk allele of PTPN22 was observed only in these patients Although SNPs in PADI4 had similar allele frequency among three groups [maximal difference 11%; (P >0.05)], the other three loci revealed statistically significant allele frequency differences (maximal difference 39% (P <0.00001), 13% (P <0.00001), and 8% (P <0.00001) in SLC22A4, PDCD1, and PTPN22, respectively) Several multiple, large-scale, genetic studies on autoimmune-disease-associated SNPs have been reported recently: peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); solute carrier family 22 members 4 and 5 (SLC22A4 and 5) in RA and Crohn's disease (CD); programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and RA; and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) in T1D, RA, and SLE  Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22, CTLA-4 and MIF. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22 Analyses of families with multiple autoimmune disorders have revealed a functional polymorphism, 620W, in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 as a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the presence of the PTPN22 protein appears to herald the development of autoantibodies in these disorders Replication of putative candidate-gene associations with rheumatoid arthritis in >4,000 samples from North America and Sweden: association of susceptibility with PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4. We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples.  Exploration of our data set with clinically relevant subsets of RA reveals that PTPN22 is associated with an earlier age at disease onset (P=.004) and that PTPN22 has a stronger effect in males than in females (P=.03)  Given the strong statistical power to replicate a true-positive association in this study, our results provide support for PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4 as RA susceptibility genes and demonstrate novel associations with clinically relevant subsets of RA In logistic regression analysis, ACPA predicted RA-development independent of PTPN22, while the PTPN22 polymorphism had no independent effect.

{"question": "Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?", "context": "The illicit drugs more commonly associated with stroke are psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine. Less commonly implicated are opioids and psychotomimetic drugs, including cannabis. Among 326 patients (184 males), the most frequent stroke risk factors overall were dyslipidaemia (187), smoking (161), hypertension (105) and obesity (92). Fifty-one patients used illicit drugs, mostly comprising marijuana and amphetamines. Patients in Adelaide are more likely to be obese, to be misusing marijuana and amphetamines, to suffer a cardioembolic event and to have a stroke that concurrently affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. RCVS was spontaneous in 37% of patients and secondary in the 63% others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants. We reported two cases of young stroke associated with drug misuse. Case 1 used amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and LSD for few yaers, and developed occlusion of a middle cerebral artery. Case 2 presented aphasia shortly after marijuana smoking. Marijuana may have accelerated stroke onset, but essential cause of stroke in this case must be protein S mutation. Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease. We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption. The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use. Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke. Marijuana may trigger a myocardial infarction and have a vasospastic effect. Despite the fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, there are only a few reports associating its use with cerebrovascular disease. We describe a patient who suffered three ischaemic strokes immediately after cannabis consumption. Cannabis use may be associated with ischaemic stroke in young patients, but its mechanism is unclear. A right occipital ischemic stroke occurred in a 37-year-old Albanese man with a previously uneventful medical history, 15 min after having smoked a cigarette with approximately 250 mg of marijuana. Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption. Three adolescent males had similar presentations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana. Episodic marijuana use may represent a risk factor for stroke in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation. Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Reported here is the case of a previously healthy young man who smoked marijuana on a daily basis and had an occipital lobe stroke; he was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden. This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden. Thus, chronic abuse of marijuana might be a risk factor for stroke. A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of which occurred whilst smoking cannabis. Substance abuse was the only identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Is there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?", "context": "The results showed that higher levels of TSH within the reference range were independently associated with the presence of CAD only among subjects less than or equal to 65 years old, suggesting age might influence the relationship. FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely correlated with the presence and severity of CAD. Moreover, lower FT3 concentrations were correlated with the Gensini score and independently predicted the presence and severity of CAD. High TSH within the reference range was associated with increased risk of coronary death in women (P(trend) 0·005), but not in men. The risk of coronary death was also increased among women with subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, compared to women with TSH of 0·50-1·4 mU/l.   Prevalence of CHD was more common in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients. The angiographic results were as follows: significant coronary disease (SH 28.1% vs. non-SH 43.8%; p=0.087); three-vessel disease (9.4% vs. 9.9%; p=0.919); two-vessel disease (12.5% vs. 13.4%; p=0.892); single-vessel disease (6.3% vs. 29.5%; p=0.051); minimal lesions (9.4% vs. 10.9%; p=0.794); and no coronary disease (62.4% vs, 45.3%; p=0.064). Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0.012) and multivessel (p = 0.009) CAD. Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.68, p < 0.001). Our study showed that FT(4) levels were associated with the presence and the severity of CAD. Also, this study suggests that elevated serum FT(4) levels even within normal range could be a risk factor for CAD.  The present meta-analysis indicates that sub-clinical hypothyroidism is associated with both, a significant risk of CHD at baseline and at follow-up. The incidence of multi-vessel disease was higher in patients with high TSH level (p=0.026). TSH level showed a significant correlation with age (r=0.109, p=0.044) and Gensini's score (r=0.117, p=0.045).

The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients irrespective of the family history was significantly higher than previously reported. Possible founder mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients were identified. Germline Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Korean Ovarian Cancer Patients: Finding Founder Mutations. The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.  Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 × 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 × 10(-3)). Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.  Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany).  Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.  Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation. In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.  About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.  The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.  OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary]. We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women.MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists.English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries. Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without. Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy. Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations. Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population. BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk. Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments. Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis. Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene. Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico. Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers. BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction. Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified. Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

Plants have evolved to cope with changing environmental conditions. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification essential in most eukaryotes that regulates stability, localization, activity, or interaction of a multitude of proteins. SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes.  SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression. Although the SUMOylation pathway has been identified and investigated in many eukaryotes, the mechanisms of SUMOylation in regulating the functions of various substrates are still poorly understood.  SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Besides phosphorylation or ubiquitylation, for which many examples of modulation by pathogens exist, a post-translational modification called SUMOylation was recently shown to be targeted by pathogenic bacteria. cruzi SUMOylated proteins are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein SUMOylation in this early divergent eukaryote.

We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. SUMOylation regulates target proteins involved in all nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, precursor-mRNA splicing and ribosome assembly. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Using high-resolution MS, we have studied global SUMOylation in human cells in a site-specific manner, identifying a total of>4,300 SUMOylation sites in>1,600 proteins.

Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Indeed, SU(VAR)3-7 is sumoylated at lysine K839; this modification is required for localization of SU(VAR)3-7 at pericentric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeres.

However, limited evidence exists from direct head to head comparisons of statins on whether the risk of DM differs among statins. Short-term statin exposure is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in persons with diabetes.

Hypophosphatemic rickets and craniosynostosis: a multicenter case series. A 20-year retrospective review identified patients with hypophosphatemic rickets and secondary craniosynostosis at 3 major craniofacial centers.  Secondary craniosynostosis develops postnatally due to metabolic or mechanical factors. The most common metabolic cause is hypophosphatemic rickets, which has a variety of etiologies. Head shape changes occur later and with a more heterogeneous presentation compared with that of primary craniosynostosis. Patients with multisutural involvement or X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets had a significant delay in presentation for craniosynostosis.  Craniosynostosis can be gene-linked, or caused by metabolic diseases, such as rickets, which results from a deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus or calcium leading to hypomineralization of the bone. X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) is the most prevalent genetic type of hypophosphatemic rickets and is caused by germ line mutations in the PHEX-gene.

A clinical report of a patient with XLH rickets and craniosynostosis is presented with a review of literature.  This may be the reason for the common association of craniosynostosis and XLH rickets.  Craniosynostosis and associated craniofacial deformities, such as frontal bossing, often occur as symptoms of vitamin D-resistant rickets in children. Similar skull deformities develop in mice with X-linked dominant hypophosphatemia, the most common form of vitamin D-resistant rickets.  The x-linked hypophosphatemic mouse is an animal model that can be used to study the role of vitamin D-resistant rickets in the development of craniosynostosis, to relate craniosynostosis to the development of associated skull deformities, and to test new treatment procedures. Craniosynostosis secondary to rickets is rarely reported, but since neither rickets nor craniosynostosis is a reportable disease, the exact incidence of both diseases is unknown.

{"question": "Is vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?", "context": "Vortioxetine is the most recently approved medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  [Vortioxetine: a new antidepressant to treat depressive episodes]. Vortioxetine is a new antidepressant, which mechanism of action is multimodal, targeting the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, 5-HT7 receptors and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT).  In short-term studies (8 weeks), vortioxetine is more efficacious than placebo in decreasing depressive symptoms as measured by the MADRS total score, response rate (vortioxetine: 53.2% vs placebo: 35.2%) and remission rate (vortioxetine: 29.2% vs placebo: 19.3%). In a long-term study (52 weeks), vortioxetine is also superior to placebo in preventing relapses and recurrences. Moreover, in second line treatment, after failure of a first line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), vortioxetine is superior to agomelatine in improving depressive symptoms and achieving response and remission.  Against this background, we feature the novel antidepressants vortioxetine, vilazodone and milnacipran/levomilnacipran with regard to their serotonin receptor targets such as the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 which may account for their specific effects on certain symptoms of depression (e.g. cognition and anxiety) as well as a characteristic side-effect profile. CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR in South Korea and is a relevant treatment option for MDD patients initiating or switching therapy. Vortioxetine: a New Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. INTRODUCTION: Vortioxetine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). EXPERT OPINION: Results of placebo-controlled trials suggest efficacy and an overall safety profile comparable to existing first-line antidepressants.  The authors suggest that vortioxetine is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise, pending additional long-term data, to become a first-line antidepressant option. Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than was placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.118 (95% CIs, -0.203 to -0.033, P = 0.007). Vortioxetine for the treatment of depression. Vortioxetine for the treatment of major depression. Vortioxetine (Lu-AA-21004; 1-[2-(2,4-dimethylphenylsulfanyl)phenyl]piperazine hydrobromide) is a novel orally active molecule that is being investigated by Lundbeck and Takeda for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a multi-modal antidepressant in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine 2.5 and 10 mg in acute treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Secondary endpoints included response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Clinical Global Impression, overall functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), health-related quality of life(EuroQol 5 Dimensions), productivity (work limitation questionnaire) and family functioning (Depression and Family Functioning Scale).RESULTS: Primary endpoint noninferiority was established and vortioxetine (n = 252) was superior to agomelatine (n = 241) by 2.2 MADRS points (p<0.01). Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action thought to be related to a combination of 2 pharmacologic actions: direct modulation of several receptors and inhibition of the serotonin transporter.To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder.This 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted from July 2010 to January 2012 among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR).Eligible subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms: vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a new antidepressant that combines a number of neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor effects that have been thought to predict efficacy as a treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders.This review summarizes the pharmacology and neurobiology of vortioxetine In the study of elderly patients, vortioxetine 5 mg (n = 136) improved 12-item Health Status Questionnaire scores significantly more than placebo (n = 148) for the domains of health perception (10.4, P &lt; 0.0001, SES of 0.54), mental health (7.9, P &lt; 0.001, SES of 0.44), and energy (6.4, P &lt; 0.05, SES of 0.28) (FAS, mixed model for repeated measures).Vortioxetine yielded significant, meaningful HRQoL improvements in 6 MDD studies of 6 to 8 weeks duration. All references included were published between 1999 and 2014.All studies that included humans and were published in English, with data describing vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD, were reviewed.Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant agent, which inhibits the 5-HT transporter protein, acts as a 5-HT3 antagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity which has shown efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in six of ten short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (completed end 2012).We performed meta-regression analyses to indirectly compare vortioxetine to seven marketed antidepressants with different mechanisms of action Data were available from 51 human trials involving vortioxetine, and included a total of 7,666 healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to at least 1 dose of vortioxetine for a total of 2,743 patient-years.Vortioxetine was effective in treating MDD in the United States at a dose of 20 mg/d Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily There was a significant difference for nausea between the two groups (OR=3.01, 95 % CI=2.22-4.09, Z=7.08, P=0.00001), but no significant differences were observed for the other four adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of major depressive disorder, our results show that a dose of 5 mg/day vortioxetine was more effective, but more easily induced nausea, compared to placebo.

Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group.Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD. There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates between vortioxetine and comparators owing to inefficacy (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.650), whereas discontinuation owing to AEs was significantly less common in the vortioxetine than in the comparator group (OR 0.728, 95% CI 0.554 to 0.957).Studies examining the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD are limited.Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a l We performed a meta-analysis to increase the statistical power of these studies and enhance our current understanding of the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD.We performed an extensive search of databases and the clinical trial registry. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.METHODS: Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily. Vortioxetine significantly improved objective and subjective measures of cognitive function in adults with recurrent MDD and these effects were largely independent of its effect on improving depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a statistically significant number of patients with MDD who were on vortioxetine have achieved a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression symptoms from baseline. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal compound that has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a limited number of heterogeneous RCTs.. Vortioxetine is an effective agent for the treatment of MDD, but it does not have any clear advantages over other available treatment options..

{"question": "Is treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?", "context": "Suboptimal serum and red blood cell folate levels have been associated with a poorer response to antidepressant therapy, a greater severity of symptoms, later onset of clinical improvement, and overall treatment resistance. This article reviews the evidence for L-methylfolate and folic acid as antidepressive agents in depression and discusses their clinical use Although further randomized controlled trials in this area appear warranted, SAMe and L-methylfolate may represent a useful addition to the AD armamentarium. Patients with depression have consistently been found to have lower levels of serum and red blood cell folate than normal or nondepressed psychiatric patients. Decreased folate levels have been associated with lowered response rates to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Recent studies have shown that augmentation with a folate supplement increases medication response in both treatment-naïve and treatment-resistant depressed patients irrespective of whether there is folate deficiency. Depressed patients with both low and normal folate levels may benefit from augmenting a primary antidepressant medication either initially, at the onset of treatment, or later after some degree of treatment resistance has been recognized. The results of this study suggest that intake of vitamin B9 may modulate the total score of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and two subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect and interpersonal difficulties.

In this study, we investigated whether the early detection of postoperative delirium in elderly patients is possible using a simple, useful behavior-assessing scale, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, and a method for comprehensively evaluating elderly persons' stress related to surgery, E-PASS.The subjects were 160 patients aged more than 75 years who underwent surgery. In this study a nursing screening instrument, the NEECHAM confusion scale, was studied for early recognition of delirium ICU patients. The psychometric characteristics and the ease of use of the NEECHAM confusion scale enables ICU nurses to early recognize delirium. The trends of the NEECHAM scores in the 3 groups were compared, and the relationship between the NEECHAM scores and suspected clinical risk factors for delirium was investigated. In groups showing an MMSE score of less than 25 or a preoperative NEECHAM score of less than 27, the incidence of postoperative delirium was 76%.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that E-PASS and the NEECHAM score facilitate assessment of the risk of postoperative delirium in elderly patients, contributing to early prevention/treatment. In this study, we investigated whether the early detection of postoperative delirium in elderly patients is possible using a simple, useful behavior-assessing scale, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, and a method for comprehensively evaluating elderly persons' stress related to surgery, E-PASS. Use of NEECHAM scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the NEECHAM confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward..

{"question": "Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?", "context": "Fighting malaria: structure-guided discovery of nonpeptidomimetic plasmepsin inhibitors. Given that the parasite needs the resulting amino acid building blocks for its growth and development, plasmepsins are an important antimalarial drug target.  Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plm I, II, IV and V. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II.  Structural basis for plasmepsin V inhibition that blocks export of malaria proteins to human erythrocytes. Plasmepsin V, an essential aspartyl protease of malaria parasites, has a key role in the export of effector proteins to parasite-infected erythrocytes. Consequently, it is an important drug target for the two most virulent malaria parasites of humans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Plasmepsin V (PmV) is an essential Plasmodium protease and a highly promising antimalarial target, which still lacks molecular characterization and drug-like inhibitors. Our inhibitors act 'on-target', confirmed by cellular interference of PmV function and biochemical interaction with inhibitors.  Our work disclosed novel pursuable drug design strategies for highly efficient PmV inhibition highlighting novel molecular elements necessary for picomolar activity against PmV. All the presented data are discussed in respect to human aspartic proteases and previously reported inhibitors, highlighting differences and proposing new strategies for drug development. High binding likeness on antimalarial target plasmepsin was detected through molecular docking.  This provides the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in Plasmodium spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV as an antimalarial drug target. The export mechanism involves the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL), which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV).  Plasmepsin II (PM II) is an attractive target for anti-malaria drug discovery, which involves in host hemoglobin degradation in the acidic food vacuole. These methods are utilized to search for inhibitors of the aspartyl proteases, plasmepsin II and cathepsin D. Plasmepsin II, a protease found in the malaria parasite, hydrolyzes human hemoglobin, the nutrient source for the parasite and is a new target for anti-malaria therapy. Given recent advances in understanding the fundamental roles of the various plasmepsins, it is likely that the most effective antimalarial plasmepsin targets will be the non-digestive vacuole plasmepsins. Plasmepsins (PMs) are essential proteases of the plasmodia parasites and are therefore promising targets for developing drugs against malaria. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. As inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets. falciparum plasmepsins II and IV make structure-based drug design of antimalarial compounds that focus on inhibiting plasmepsins possible. The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug development. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies. In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. These results shed light on the role of V105 and T108 residues in plasmepsin specificities, and they should be useful in structure-based design of novel, selective inhibitors that may serve as antimalarial drugs. The aspartic proteases plasmepsins, whose inhibition leads to parasite death, are classified as targets for the design of potent drugs. A large compound library of about 1 million chemical compounds was docked on 5 different targets of plasmepsins using two different docking software, namely FlexX and AutoDock. Plasmodium aspartic proteases known as plasmepsins play an important role on haemoglobin degradation and are being studied as drug targets for chemotherapy of malaria. Our study revealed about 100 parasite-coded gene products that included many known drug targets such as Pf hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, Pf L-lactate dehydrogenase, and Plasmepsins. The two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, from Plasmodium falciparum have recently emerged as potential targets. Plasmepsins are highly promising as drug targets, especially when combined with the inhibition of falcipains that are also involved in hemoglobin catabolism. Among such enzymes, Plasmepsins (aspartic proteases) and, especially, Falcipains (cysteine proteases) are highly promising antimalarial drug targets. The high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plasmepsin, an aspartic protease, which is involved in the hemoglobin breakdown into smaller peptides emerged as a crucial target to develop new chemical entities to counter malaria. were employed in order to develop new chemical entities targeting Plm II.

We developed a potent inhibitor of plasmepsin V, called WEHI-842, which directly mimics the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL).

{"question": "Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?", "context": "Ang II treatment also led to a significant increment in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which could be fully abolished by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium, indicating that Ang II enhanced oxidative stress via a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no effect on MLCK activity and MLC20 phosphorylation.  Significant reductions of AII effects on podocyte TRPC6 were also observed after pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium (DPI).  Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.  Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.  Moreover, NADPH oxidase activation by beta CD (145.5+/-9.0%; control: 98.6+/-1.6%) was also abrogated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (100.4+/-3.2%) and diphenylene iodonium (9.5+/-3.3%). We used structurally diverse NADPH oxidase inhibitors, aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, 100-1000microM), apocynin (100-1000microM), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 3-30microM), to inhibit intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in N27 cells. Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. The effects of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, on key parameters of PSC activation were evaluated in vitro. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAâ. Diphenylene iodonium is an inhibitor of the respiratory burst-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAâ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. In addition, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium or apocynin) also prevented microglia proliferation, suggesting that this may be the source of hydrogen peroxide. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium, apocynin, D-(+)-neopterine) also significantly blunted the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of K(+), Cl(-)-cotransport and apoptosis induced by N-ethylmaleimide. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the solubilized oxidase of neutrophils was inhibited 36% by diphenylene iodonium at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the enzyme flavoprotein content. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65 Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38 Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186) The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin ANG II further increased superoxide production in LP only, and this was inhibited by coincubation with diphenylene iodonium or apocynin (inhibitor of NADPH oxidase complex) Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection with siRNAs of MyD88, PKCalpha, Src, p47(phox), p300, and HDAC4. Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively.  With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  The inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, and of the mitochondrial electron transport system at complex II by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), significantly inhibited both AGE-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 expression, whereas these effects were potentiated by rotenone and antimycin A, specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and III, respectively.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.  The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ. Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects. UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors. Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186). Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection w Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65. The use of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, to investigate the antimicrobial action of human monocyte derived macrophages. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAβ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation. We compared the pharmacological profiles of the commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin and 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzolsulphonyl-fluoride (AEBSF), as well as the novel triazolo pyrimidine VAS3947. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha rapidly stimulated the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by isolated microglia, and this was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, implying that the cytokines were acting directly on microglia to stimulate the NADPH oxidase. The fractions achieved the same effects that known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, but they presented better hydrosolubility.

Inhibition of Ddc by AADC inhibitor NSD-1015 or anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) reduced brain volume and body length.  We evaluated this in vivo by reverse dialysis of the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) inhibitor NSD-1015 (20μM) and selected concentrations of l- or d-tyrosine.  Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 To establish the neurotransmitter role(s) of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in its own right, we attempted to clarify whether i.p. injection of a DOPA antagonist, DOPA cyclohexyl ester (CHE), would antagonize the behavioral responses of conscious rats to DOPA in the presence of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) (100 mg/kg i.p.), a central aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. TH and TPH activities were determined in tissue extracts by measuring the accumulation of L-Dopa and 5-HTP respectively, following the administration of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015.  Results of a neurochemical study of the effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazole and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites determined by HPLC on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) in the brain structures of Wistar rats are reported.  . When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015) NSD 1015 (general AADC inhibitor) monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase)  the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) inhibitor NSD-1015 An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood. 6S-BH4 increased extracellular DOPA levels in the presence of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (an index of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity), to an extent similar to the increase induced by 6R-BH4. 5-HT synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in the neurointermediate lobe of male Long-Evans rats following the administration of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Monoamine synthesis was studied in different parts of the brain by measuring the accumulated dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 30 min after NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl, 100 mg/kg) an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, given i.p. HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection was used to make concurrent measurements of the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in selected brain regions (striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, medial periventricular hypothalamus) and thoracic spinal cords of rats treated with NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. The activity of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons has been estimated from measurements of: concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; the ratio of the concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine; the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan following the administration of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., NSD 1015); the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the rate of decline of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid following the administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., pargyline). The accumulation of dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) after administration of NSD 1015 to inhibit aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase was determined as an index of NE synthesis. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 markedly increased the dopa concentration. Using a microdialysis technique, the rat striatum was perfused with NSD-1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and the amount of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulating in dialysate was measured as an index of in vivo activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. Also, we studied the effect of MnCl2 on extracellular levels of l-Dopa in the presence of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor 3-hydroxybencilhydracine-HCl (NSD 1015). The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats. An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood.  [Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015].

The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA.  Furthermore, the ethanol-induced enhancement of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the mesolimbic dopamine terminal area after NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase) was completely antagonized by mecamylamine in doses (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg) that exerted no effects per se. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in both the corpus striatum and limbic areas (nucleus accumbens) after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase with NSD-1015, indicating an enhanced synthesis of dopamine in these brain regions. Estradiol benzoate-treated rats had significantly lower anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation after intraperitoneal administration of 3,4-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015), an irreversible inhibitor of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase whereas methylene blue did not affect anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation when compared to controls. The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. Inhibition of PE synthesis by i.p. injection of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, produced a reversal of the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327. After 42 hr of abstinence, rats were challenged with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline, followed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, ip). Following motor activity observations, the cerebral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 (100 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally) was administered and 30 min. later the animals were decapitated for subsequent analysis of the accumulated forebrain DOPA and 5-HTP levels, as an estimate of the rate of monoamine synthesis. The utility of this technique was demonstrated by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans. Addition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), prevented the formation of N-acetylcompounds from L-[3H]tyrosine, without resulting in an accumulation of label in L-DOPA. The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine dihydrochloride) was then given ICV twice daily in a volume of 5.0 microliters in the following doses: 0.005, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 micrograms.

{"question": "Can telomere length shortening be reversed by telomerase?", "context": "Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate length at the molecular level.  High telomerase activity is detected in nearly all human cancers but most human cells are devoid of telomerase activity. There is well-documented evidence that reactivation of telomerase occurs during cellular transformation. In humans, tumors can rely in reactivation of telomerase or originate in a telomerase positive stem/progenitor cell, or rely in alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent telomere-length maintenance mechanism.  Together, these observations may provoke a re-evaluation of telomere and telomerase based therapies, both in telomerase inhibition for cancer therapy and telomerase activation for tissue regeneration and anti-ageing strategies. Telomeres progressively shorten throughout life. A hallmark of advanced malignancies is the ability for continuous cell divisions that almost universally correlates with the stabilization of telomere length by the reactivation of telomerase. Telomerase-mediated telomere elongation provides cell populations with the ability to proliferate indefinitely.

{"question": "Are Ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) enriched in segmental duplications?", "context": "Here we address the process by which CNVs become depleted of UCEs. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.  ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs). In addition, here we show that these elements are preferentially found in pathogenic deletions (enrichment ratio 3.6 vs. 0.5 in duplications), and that this association is not related with a higher content of genes. In contrast, pathogenic CNVs lacking UCEs showed almost a threefold higher content in genes We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating, along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a distinct subset.

{"question": "Do normal cells express the protein TERT?", "context": "Since telomerase has been recognized as a relevant factor distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, it has become a very promising target for anti-cancer therapy Telomerase plays a pivotal role in cellular immortality and tumorigenesis. Its activity is normally not detectable in most somatic cells while it is reactivated in the vast majority of cancer cells. Therefore, inhibition of telomerase has been viewed as a promising anticancer approach due to its specificity for cancer cells. Telomerase activity is found in 85%-90% of all human cancers but not in their adjacent normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component in the telomerase complex that plays an important role in telomerase activity. elomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in carcinogenesis and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. Since only tumor cells that express telomerase activity would activate this promoter, the hTERT proximal promoter allows for preferential expression of viral genes in tumor cells, leading to selective viral replication", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}
{"question": "Is there any involvement of the long non-coding RNA Gomafu in schizophrenia?", "context": "The long non-coding RNA Gomafu is acutely regulated in response to neuronal activation and involved in schizophrenia-associated alternative splicing. Here, we profile these transcriptomic responses and show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dynamically regulated by neuronal activation, including acute downregulation of the lncRNA Gomafu, previously implicated in brain and retinal development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Gomafu binds directly to the splicing factors QKI and SRSF1 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1) and dysregulation of Gomafu leads to alternative splicing patterns that resemble those observed in SZ for the archetypal SZ-associated genes DISC1 and ERBB4. Finally, we show that Gomafu is downregulated in post-mortem cortical gray matter from the superior temporal gyrus in SZ. These results functionally link activity-regulated lncRNAs and alternative splicing in neuronal function and suggest that their dysregulation may contribute to neurological disorders.

We report a 12 years old female patient with an overlap syndrome involving autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient presented with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, malaise, polyarthralgia, arthritis and butterfly rash on the face. Some of the clinical characteristics of SLE patients observed were nephritis (53.7%), fever (53.26%), neuropsychological disorder (36.18%), malar/butterfly rash (27.6%), pulmonary disorder (22.6%), photosensitivity (21.6%), cardiac involvement (21.1%) and oral ulcers (19.09%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus and infections: a retrospective study in Saudis. The prevalence of the following manifestations was significantly higher for pediatric than for adult-onset disease including: lupus nephritis (43% pediatric vs 26.4% for adult-onset), hematological disorders (57% vs 36.4%), photosensitivity (20% vs 9%), butterfly rash (61% vs 35.5%) and mucosal ulceration (11.4% vs 4%).

{"question": "Is infertility characteristic of individuals with Fanconi anemia?", "context": "PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in homologous recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Mono-allelic mutations in PALB2 increase the risk of breast, pancreatic, and other cancers, and biallelic mutations cause Fanconi anemia (FA).  Moreover, mutant males showed reduced fertility due to impaired meiosis and increased apoptosis in germ cells. Interestingly, mutant meiocytes showed a significant defect in sex chromosome synapsis, which likely contributed to the germ cell loss and fertility defect. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Substantially reduced AMH levels in females with FA suggest a primary ovarian defect associated with reduced fertility. Measurement of AMH at the time of FA diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of AMH levels at regular intervals may be useful for the timely management of complications related to POI such as subfertility/infertility, osteoporosis, and menopausal symptoms. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility.  Reduced fertility is one clinical manifestation among other well known Fanconi anemia features.

{"question": "Does mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?", "context": "mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Senescent cells secrete a combination of factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response, but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses.

Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy with cochlear dose reduction compared with conventional X-ray radiotherapy for medulloblastoma in childhood.We developed a Markov model to describe health states of 6-year-old children with medulloblastoma after treatment with proton or X-ray radiotherapy All patients completed therapy without interruption.Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors: spinal theca irradiation For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well.The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors: reduction of the supratentorial target volume This review describes the role of radiation in general and proton therapy in particular for the treatment of medulloblastoma, central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, and the recently described embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. For 6 MV x-rays>60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well.CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET.

The interplay of active and repressive histone modifications is assumed to have a key role in the regulation of gene expression. In contrast to this generally accepted view, we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications. Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development. In the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks.

{"question": "Is Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?", "context": "Doxorubicin (DOXO) is widely used to treat solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by side effects including serious cardiotoxicity due to cardiomyocyte damage.  The results provide direct evidence for the role of catalase in doxorubicin cardiotoxic responses. These results do not support the possibility that mitomycin C potentiates the acute cardiotoxic effects produced by doxorubicin. The anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is converted by the enzyme carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) into its cardiotoxic metabolite doxorubicinol The clinical efficiency of the highly potent antitumor agent doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxic effects Doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active chemotherapeutic drug, faces limitations in clinical application due to severe cardiotoxic effects (mainly through increased oxidative stress) Clinical uses of doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active anticancer agent, are limited by its severe cardiotoxic side effects associated with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis Doxorubicin (DOX) and trastuzumab (TRZ) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents in the breast cancer setting, limited by their cardiotoxic side effects Twisting and ironing: doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by mitochondrial DNA damage. Cardiotoxic effects were reported in 15 (5%) of 291 children receiving treatment including doxorubicin. On the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters.Hesperidin may have a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Methods of reducing or preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been suggested, including an investigational doxorubicin analog, mitoxantrone ( Novantrone ). The most cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin, is the most potent inducer of superoxide generation, while epirubicin, which is less cardiotoxic, has a relatively limited effect on superoxide production. The mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is likely multifactorial and most importantly, the genetic factors predisposing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity are unknown. As doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is considered irreversible, early detection of cardiotoxicity and prevention of overt heart failure is essential. Although there are monitoring guidelines for cardiotoxicity, optimal timing for early detection of subclinical doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is still obscure. Quercetin attenuates doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by modulating Bmi-1 expression. However, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity of the heart has largely limited its clinical use. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (top1mt) is a novel limiting factor of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy induces cardiotoxicity, which limits its clinical application. he clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) and other anthracyclines is limited by a dosage-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can lead to cardiomyopathy.  Besides its cardiotoxic effect, doxorubicin also elicits inflammatory effects in vivo. 7-Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) has recently been used as a protector against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo. Doxorubicin is an effective antineoplastic agent, but it frequently causes dose-related cardiotoxic effects.  Among these analogs, idarubicin (4-demethoxy-daunorubicin) was shown to be less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin i Verapamil has also been suggested to potentiate the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.

Neonates with high nPTX3 concentrations also have lowered APGAR scores, increased rate of respiratory distress syndrome, clinical sepsis, IVH, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged NICU stay. In terms of predicting the prognosis of sepsis with heart failure complications, the PTX3 value's area under ROC curve was larger than that of BNP (respectively 0. 844, 0. 472).CONCLUSION: The PTX3 is an objective biochemical marker in diagnosis of sepsis; it is helpful in assessment of severity and prognosis of sepsis; it also has a certain clinical value in the assessment of sepsis cardiovascular function damage.

Melanosis oculi is often underestimated as a risk factor for uveal melanoma and glaucoma. Ophthalmic surveillance, every 6 or 12 months is important, in patients with ocular melanocytosis for early detection of high risk diseases.  One of about 400 patients with ODM followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. Excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ODM may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ODM should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma. The authors suggest that a national registry of ODM patients be created and prospective data collected to better assess the risk of developing uveal melanoma. In the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (ODM) and uveal melanoma is well recognized.  Malignant melanomas may arise in the uveal tract, the conjunctiva, the skin of the eyelid, or the orbit.

This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. It is currently known that CD24 serves as a costimulatory factor of T cells that regulate their homeostasis and proliferation, while in B cells, CD24 is functionally involved in cell activation and differentiation. CD24 can enhance autoimmune diseases in terms of its protective role in the clonal deletion of autoreactive thymocytes Multiple B cell-dependent mechanisms contributing to inflammatory demyelination of the CNS have been explored using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4 T cell-dependent animal model for multiple sclerosis.  The role of B cells in multiple sclerosis: rationale for B-cell-targeted therapies. Interest in CD8+ T cells and B cells was initially inspired by observations in multiple sclerosis rather than in animal models: CD8+ T cells predominate in multiple sclerosis lesions, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in CSF have long been recognised as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and anti-B-cell therapies showed considerable efficacy in multiple sclerosis. Differential effects of fingolimod on B-cell populations in multiple sclerosis. Unaltered regulatory B-cell frequency and function in patients with multiple sclerosis. B cells are increasingly recognized as major players in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. These observations underscore the B cell's contribution to the putative underpinnings of multiple sclerosis. Data suggesting that B cells play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis have been accumulating for the past five decades, demonstrating that the cerebrospinal fluid and central nervous system tissues of multiple sclerosis patients contain B cells, plasma cells, antibodies, and immunoglobulins. B-cell-targeted treatment for multiple sclerosis: mechanism of action and clinical data. Subset composition and cytokine production of B cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple sclerosis patients under Fingolimod treatment, untreated multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. In particular, antigen presentation between B cells and T cells, increased trafficking of B cells across the blood-brain barrier, and autoantibodies produced by plasma cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence supports a major role of B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathology of B cells and their role in central nervous system autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.

Yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague Pneumonic plague is a deadly respiratory disease caused by Yersinia pestis On July 8, 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, in a blood specimen collected from a man (patient A) hospitalized with pneumonia. Early emergence of Yersinia pestis as a severe respiratory pathogen. The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease  plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, has historically been regarded as one of the deadliest pathogens known to mankind, having caused three major pandemics. After being transmitted by the bite of an infected flea arthropod vector, Y. pestis can cause three forms of human plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, Plague is an infectious disease caused by the Yersinia pestis microorganism, which is transmitted to the human host from a natural reservoir (different rodent species) by a flea bite. Plague is still encountered in humans in the areas of its enzootic prevalence in local rodent populations. Infection by flea bite results in a bubonic or septicemic plague, possibly complicated by secondary pneumonia. The person with pneumonic symptoms may be a source of a droplet-borne inhalatory infection for other people who consequently develop primary pneumonic plague.  uring pneumonic plague, the bacterium Yersinia pestis elicits the development of inflammatory lung lesions that continue to expand throughout infection.  In November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of an increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of pneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts.  Pneumonic plague is a fatal disease caused by Yersinia pestis that is associated with a delayed immune response in the lungs", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

{"question": "Does Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?", "context": "Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development Unlike other PRC2-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, Jarid2-deficient ESCs show a severe differentiation block, altered colony morphology, and distinctive patterns of deregulated gene expression. Here, we show that Jarid2(-/-) ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered β-catenin activity. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. Co-culture of Jarid2(-/-) with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and β-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development. Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor.

{"question": "Do brown fat cells produce heat?", "context": "WAT and BAT are both involved in energy balance. WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. Because brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat, increasing energy expenditure by augmenting BAT-mediated thermogenesis may represent an approach to counter obesity and its complications. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. This nonshivering thermogenesis is crucial for mammals as a defense against cold and obesity/diabetes. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat cells produces heat by dissipating the energy generated by fatty acid and glucose oxidation. Brown fat biology and thermogenesis. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. Calorimetric measurements from cell suspensions showed that ATP increased basal heat production of isolated brown fat cells by approximately 40% but had no effect on the greater than fivefold increase in heat production seen with maximal adrenergic stimulation. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or to excessive energy intake; stimulation of brown fat development and function may thus counteract obesity. The occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells that has been revealed in 65 out of the total 180 samples (36%), suggests that the oxidation of fat for the thermogenesis proceeds in the brown fat tissue and that brown fat cells partially undergo fat depletion. Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified \"beige\" or \"brite\" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1 The ability of brown adipocytes (fat cells) to dissipate energy as heat shows great promise for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders Inappropriate heat dissipation ignites brown fat thermogenesis in mice with a mutant thyroid hormone receptor α1 Brown fat and vascular heat dissipation: The new cautionary tail Brown adipose produces heat as a defense against hypothermia and obesity, and the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue depots is associated with improved metabolic phenotypes.  In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production.  It is inferred that brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some time after) anesthesia.  Parallel measurements of heat production and thermogenin content in brown fat cells during cold acclimation of rats. The classical white adipose tissue builds up energy in the form of triglycerides and is useful for preventing fatigue during periods of low caloric intake and the brown adipose tissue instead of inducing fat accumulation can produce energy as heat. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified \"beige\" or \"brite\" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1. White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat, whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to produce heat. The main function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is to produce heat in response to cold. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat. Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a specialized fat that dissipates energy to produce heat, plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance. Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. In the present study, the thermogenesis of human brown fat tissue was suggested chiefly with regard to the occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells. In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers. Adult humans have heat-producing and energy-consuming brown adipose tissue in the clavicular region of the neck. Brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight. In human perirenal brown fat tissue, darkly stained fat-depleted cells (D) occupy, with other cell types (CR, CR'), an important part in the reversible heat production cycle of the brown fat tissue. Brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}

This concept has been further supported by the identification of the most common genetic cause for both diseases, an aberrantly expanded hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC/ CCCCGG sequence located in a non-coding region of the gene C9orf72. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neurone loss resulting in muscle weakness, spasticity and ultimately death. 5-10% are caused by inherited mutations, most commonly C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. In this article, we will review the brief characterizations of the C9ORF72 gene, the expansion mutations, the related disorders, and their features, followed by a discussion of the deficiency knowledge of C9ORF72 mutations. Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene may be a major cause not only of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease but also of late onset psychosis. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a genetically heterogenous syndrome and has been associated most recently with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion within the C9ORF72 gene.

This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that VPA has radiosensitizing effects for gliomas and radioprotective influence on normal brain tissue or hippocampal neurons. The results of several retrospective studies have also indicated potential benefit to improve survival of patients with GBM. Moreover, the promising treatment results of a phase 2 trial of concurrent radiation therapy, temozolomide, and VPA for patients with GBM have been recently reported.  While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients.  Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study.

{"question": "Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?", "context": "A unique organelle for studying membrane biochemistry is the mitochondrion whose functionality depends on a coordinated supply of proteins and lipids. Mitochondria are capable of synthesizing several lipids autonomously such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and in part phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane.  Diphosphatidylglycerol was confined to the mitochondrial fraction, where it represented about 7% of the total phosphoacylglycerols.  Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);  The polyglycerophosphatides (typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as intermediates.  Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained significant proportions of solvent front phospholipid (SFP) and whereas the mitochondrial SFP displayed the relatively unsaturated fatty acid composition characteristic of diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), the fatty acids of the microsomal SFP were distinctly more saturated. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). The enzyme responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylglycerol to diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) in the presence of cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol is firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes and is not extracted with hypotonic or hypertonic media or with nonionic detergents. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria. In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). 90% or more of the phospholipid, cardiolipin was found in the mitochondrial membranes of wild type and petite yeast. Furthermore, the same mechanism for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin was operational in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria Cardiolipin (CL) is a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, playing important roles in maintaining the functional integrity and dynamics of mitochondria in animals and yeasts Cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondria, is involved in the biogenesis, the dynamics, and the supramolecular organization of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, is crucial for both mitochondrial function and cellular processes outside of the mitochondria Since it has been recognized that mitochondria are crucial not only for energy metabolism but also for other cellular functions, there has been a growing interest in cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin, the main anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, is expected to be a determinant in this adaptive mechanism since it modulates the activity of most membrane proteins Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold.  Increasing levels of cardiolipin differentially influence packing of phospholipids found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to conditions that affect mitochondrial metabolism as a model to determine the possible role of cardiolipin in stress adaptation.  This decline of respiration was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of (1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome oxidase), two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase activity, a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) or cardiolipin, a specific component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, represents about 4% of the total lipid content. Experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on CDP-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations. We have shown that decrease of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membrane occurs early during ischemia, and only during the irreversible phase of ischemia are phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine broken down.

Nephrotic syndrome is an unusual manifestation of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN). Twelve patients with IgAN with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome were evaluated and followed up. All patients presented with generalized edema.  The clinical features of sudden onset of generalized edema, initial heavy proteinuria and initial severe hypoalbuminemia might help identify the subset of patients, especially in low grade IgAN. Most patients presented within 3 months duration (61.4%) and the most common symptom was puffiness of face (98.45%) followed by pedal edema (91%).  We analyzed medical records of 290 patients with diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome as defined by International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC), between January 1987 and December 2000, at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar.

{"question": "Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?", "context": "PURPOSE: Histone H3.3 (H3F3A) mutation in the codon for lysine 27 (K27M) has been found as driver mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of thalamic gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse. We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare, and there is a single study, a seminal discovery showing association of histone H3.3 and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 mutation with a DNA methylation signature. Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in pediatric glioblastoma. Somatic mutations of the H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes encoding the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recurrent mutations affecting the histone H3.3 residues Lys27 or indirectly Lys36 are frequent drivers of pediatric high-grade gliomas (over 30% of HGGs). Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation.

Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1 interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry. DNA replication through hard-to-replicate sites, including both highly transcribed RNA Pol II and Pol III genes, requires the S. pombe Pfh1 helicase. Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II.   Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites.

Pfh1 Is an Accessory Replicative Helicase that Interacts with the Replisome to Facilitate Fork Progression and Preserve Genome Integrity. Thus, we conclude that Pfh1 is an accessory DNA helicase that interacts with the replisome and promotes replication and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. Consistent with this interpretation, Pfh1 co-purified with many key replisome components, including the hexameric MCM helicase, replicative DNA polymerases, RPA, and the processivity clamp PCNA in an S phase dependent manner. Although Pfh1 affected replication and suppressed DNA damage at discrete sites throughout the genome, Pfh1 and the replicative DNA polymerase bound to similar extents to both Pfh1-dependent and independent sites, suggesting that Pfh1 is proximal to the replication machinery during S phase.

Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. To investigate the expression profile of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to UVA and UVB we employed a reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach using degenerate primers derived from the conserved catalytic domain of PTKs.  By 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3'RACE-PCR), a novel fusion transcript was identified between the ETV6 and the Abelson-related gene (ARG) at 1q25, resulting in a chimeric protein consisting of the HLH oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the SH2, SH3, and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domains of ARG.

{"question": "Does PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds with HDL-receptor (HDL-R)?", "context": "Recently it was revealed that the secreted Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) binds with LDL-receptor (LDL-R) causing its degradation in the lysosome with the result of LDL-C accumulating in the blood. The major goal of this study is to identify peptide/s from the catalytic domain of hPCSK9 that can block the binding of hPCSK9 and LDL-R and therefore can reduce LDL-R degradation leading to the clearance of LDL-C from the plasma. In vitro administration of SRT3025 to cultured AML12 hepatocytes attenuated Pcsk9 secretion and its binding to Ldlr, thereby reducing Pcsk9-mediated Ldlr degradation and increasing Ldlr expression and LDL uptake. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which involves in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism by interacting with the LDL receptor, is considered as a potent therapeutic target for treating hypercholesterolemia.  Taken together, these results suggested that the IgG1-PA4 can be served as a potential candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting PCSK9-mediated degradation of cell surface LDLRs. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, escorting it to its destruction in the lysosome and thereby preventing the recirculation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface.  However, statins have low efficiency because they also increase PCSK9 which targets LDLR for degradation. Inhibition of the enzyme PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), which is involved in depletion of the LDL-receptor, is a new pharmacologic approach.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) modulates LDL-c through post-translational degradation of the LDLR. Mechanistically, hepatic S1P KD was shown to decrease the liver and plasma levels of the protein proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades LDLR protein.  We report here the development of sdAbs targeting human PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) as an alternative to anti-PCSK9 mAbs. PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9) protein plays an important role in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism, due to its role in the degradation of the LDL receptor. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptors, leading to their degradation Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds LDL receptors, targeting them for degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor and targets it for degradation, has emerged as an important regulator of serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk Secreted proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) at the cell surface and disrupts the normal recycling of the LDLR Proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and cardiovascular risk, is produced in liver and secreted into plasma where it binds hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR), leading to their degradation Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and is therefore a prominent therapeutic target for reducing LDL-cholesterol In the present study we scanned the related gene of a clinically diagnosed autosomal genetic hypercholesterolemia family for the possible mutations and established eukaryotic expression vector of mutation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene with gene recombination technique to investigate the contributions of the variation on low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) metabolism and function alternation.Mutation detection was conducted for LDL-R, apolipoprotein B(100) (apoB(100)) and PCSK9 gene with nucleotide sequencing in a Chinese FH family Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) provides a key step in LDL metabolism by stimulating LDL receptor degradation. The proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) pathway plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism by promoting LDL-receptor degradation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in LDL receptor processing. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLr) in hepatocytes, and its expression in mouse liver has been shown to decrease with fenofibrate treatment.We developed a sandwich ELISA using recombinant human PCSK9 protein and 2 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against human PCSK9. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enhances the degradation of the LDLR and modulates liver CD81 levels. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism is governed by proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which down-regulates LDL receptor expression, resulting in higher LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is gaining attention as a key regulator of serum LDL-cholesterol (LDLC). The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene regulates cholesterol homoeostasis by accelerating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation resulting in the decreased catabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leading to hypercholesterolaemia. Low density lipoprotein binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in human plasma and inhibits PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor degradation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a regulator of LDL-cholesterol receptor homeostasis and emerges as a therapeutic target in the prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease.

{"question": "Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?", "context": "TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex Exome sequencing studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including TBR1, a master regulator of cortical development. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. T-Brain-1--A Potential Master Regulator in Autism Spectrum Disorders. T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism. The activity-regulated gene expression of transcription factors is required for neural plasticity and function in response to neuronal stimulation. T-brain-1 (TBR1), a critical neuron-specific transcription factor for forebrain development, has been recognized as a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorders.  Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  Next-generation sequencing recently revealed that recurrent disruptive mutations in a few genes may account for 1% of sporadic autism cases. Coupling these novel genetic data to empirical assays of protein function can illuminate crucial molecular networks. Here we demonstrate the power of the approach, performing the first functional analyses of TBR1 variants identified in sporadic autism. T-brain-1 (TBR1) is a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. In 1995, Tbr1 was first identified from a subtractive hybridization that compared mouse embryonic and adult telencephalons. Previous studies of Tbr1 (-∕-) mice have indicated critical roles for TBR1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Neuronal migration and axonal projection are two important developmental features controlled by TBR1. Recently, recurrent de novo disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Human genetic studies have identified TBR1 as a high-confidence risk factor for ASDs. TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex. De novo TBR1 mutations in sporadic autism disrupt protein functions. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. Neuronal excitation upregulates Tbr1, a high-confidence risk gene of autism, mediating Grin2b expression in the adult brain.

{"question": "Is sonidegib effective for basal cell carcinoma?", "context": "This review of the literature aims to describe previous and current treatment options for oral therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NMSC otherwise unamenable to standard treatment. Oral Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors Vismodegib, Sonidegib, and Taladegib have shown to be effective in several trials.  Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib.  The recent development of novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors for high-risk BCC (including oral vismodegib and sonidegib) may represent a paradigm shift towards medical management of NMSC. Sonidegib (Odomzo®), an oral smoothened (SMO) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy, or adults with recurrent laBCC following surgery or radiation therapy.  The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

{"question": "Is there a sequence bias in MNase digestion patterns?", "context": "In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons. Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments. We propose that combined MNase/exoIII digestion can be applied to in situ chromatin for unbiased genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions that is not influenced by DNA sequences at the core/linker junctions.

Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors. We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. After partial uncoiling of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer by Pol II and backtracking of the enzyme, nucleosomal DNA recoils on the octamer, locking Pol II in the arrested state. Histone chaperones and transcription factors TFIIS, TFIIF and FACT facilitate transcription through chromatin using different molecular mechanisms. Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins.

{"question": "Is tretinoin effective for photoaging?", "context": "Background. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 5% retinoic acid peel combined with microdermabrasion for facial photoaging. .Conclusion. This study demonstrated that 5% retinoic acid peel cream combined with microdermabrasion was safe and effective in the treatment of photoaging in the Iranian population.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a double-conjugate retinoid cream demonstrated early reductions in photodamage and improvements in Hydration. AHA-Ret induced less Erythema vs retinol and was more tolerable vs retinol and tretinoin. These comparative products include prescription tretinoin, physician strength idebenone, kinetin, polyhydroxy, lactic and glycolic acids in reversing signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: Either topical tretinoin (0.25%) or retinol (0.25%) can be used safely and effectively when applied in office immediately after SA peeling to ameliorate signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome of Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% cream does not differ from the one of tretinoin 0.025% cream. Clinical results were not statistically different.  INTRODUCTION: Topical tretinoin is considered the gold standard to treat photoaged skin, but it is associated with side effects and only available upon prescription. Tretinoin is commonly used topically for acne treatment and in the treatment of photoaging. BACKGROUND: Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis. Topical tretinoin is established as an effective treatment for photoaging. BACKGROUND Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Tretinoin is the only pharmacologic compound shown to partially reverse some signs of photoaging. Although once considered an irreversible process, it is now established that photoaging can be treated by topical tretinoin. Moreover, studies that have elucidated photoaging pathophysiology have produced significant evidence that topical tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), the only agent approved so far for the treatment of photoaging, also works to prevent it. BACKGROUND AND DESIGN The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms. Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin. The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans. * A cream containing 0.05% tretinoin (Retinova((R)) is approved for treatment of sun-induced skin damage (\"photoaging\").

{"question": "Are TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?", "context": "Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.  The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome. Disruptions of topological chromatin domains cause pathogenic rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome. The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure. Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes.  Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin.

{"question": "Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?", "context": "Evidence of reduced recombination rate in human regulatory domains. We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets (Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": false}

Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%.  OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT.  More recently, antiangiogenic agents including enzastaurin, cediranib, bevacizumab, and others that target mainly the VEGF pathway, have been evaluated in this highly angiogenic disease. Among them, only bevacizumab has been associated with clear anti-tumor activity, although the lack of control studies limits the impact of the results to date. Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations, substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research.

{"question": "Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?", "context": "Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions By adopting a method originally designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful predators with a rich behavioural repertoire. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system.

PURPOSE The successful use of nadolol as an alternative to propranolol therapy in three cases of infantile hemangioma is reported. Propranolol has been used successfully in a limited number of children with infantile hemangiomas. CONCLUSIONS High-dose Propranolol is very effective in the treatment of infantile hemangioma with minor side effects and short disease period. Propranolol is novel and safe medication for treatment of infantile hemangioma. Propranolol is the only Food and Drug Administration approved therapy for treatment of patients with this vascular anomaly and should be considered first-line therapy for genital infantile hemangiomas. CONCLUSION Propranolol may be a promising therapeutic modality for infantile hemangioma. Propranolol, which is often used to treat cutaneous infantile hemangiomas, is not currently standard treatment for intracranial infantile hemangiomas. Preliminary results of propranolol treatment for patients with infantile hemangioma. Propranolol therapy is changing the treatment paradigm for infantile hemangioma. Propranolol should be considered as a first-line treatment of infantile hemangiomas..

{"question": "Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?", "context": "Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. DNA methylation directly silences genes with non-CpG island promoters and establishes a nucleosome occupied promoter. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters.  Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar.  DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning.  DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. he induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted.", "options": ["True", "False"], "label": true}
{"question": "Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?", "context": "DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response. The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR.

{"question": "Do chromatin features predict genes associated with eQTLs?", "context": "Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict>90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Cell type-specific gene expression in humans involves complex interactions between regulatory factors and DNA at enhancers and promoters. Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes 150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature.

For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.  Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures.   Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing. Subsequent analysis of pooled data from both phase III trials with solanezumab showed a reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. Secondary analyses of EXPEDITION studies suggested a smaller functional effect of solanezumab relative to cognition. An increasing effect of solanezumab over 18 months was shown for cognition and function.

Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations inCOL1A1orCOL1A2and show autosomal dominant inheritance, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. The majority of OI cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by low bone mass and recurrent fractures. Most OI cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are attributed to mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2).  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterised by low bone mineral density resulting in fractures. 85-90% of patients with OI carry a variant in the type 1 collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by susceptibility to bone fractures, and range in severity from a subtle increase in fracture frequency to death in the perinatal period. Most patients have defects in type I collagen biosynthesis with autosomal-dominant inheritance, but many autosomal-recessive genes have been reported. To investigate mutation of COL1A1 gene and analyze the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in a family with osteogenesis imperfecta Dominant inheritance of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes that encode type I collagen, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of bone formation, resulting in low bone mass and an increased propensity to fracture. It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I is characterized by bone fragility without significant deformity, osteopenia, normal stature, blue sclerae, and autosomal dominant inheritance. Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of type I collagen, suggesting that the OI type I phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent expression of either COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes encoding the chains of type I collagen. Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A2 and COL1A1 genes of type I collagen.  Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of connective tissue, mainly caused by mutations in the collagen type I genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2). Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. In approximately 90% of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, mutations in either of the genes encoding the pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 chains of type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) can be identified. Autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. ext-generation sequencing technology was used to screen a panel of known OI genes.RESULTS: In 41 probands, we identified 28 different disease-causing variants of 9 different known OI genes. Eleven of the variants are novel. Ten of the 28 variants are located in COL1A1, five in COL1A2, three in BMP1, three in FKBP10, two in TMEM38B, two in P3H1, and one each in CRTAP, SERPINF1, and SERPINH1.  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures after minimal trauma.

{"question": "Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?", "context": "We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces. Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles. \"Splicing speckles\" are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA. Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles.

However, we could not conclusively confirm whether cilengitide 2000mg/5/week was the optimum regime, as only one trial using this protocol was included in our study. Cilengitide (CGT) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for GBM treatment by targeting the integrins avβ3 and avβ5 over-expressed on GBM cells. Cilengitide is recently failed in Phase III CENTRIC trial in unselected patients with GBM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin β3 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs. he addition of molecularly targeted drugs to TEM + RAD did not improve the OS of patients with GBM; however, it did improve PFS in patients treated by cilengitide who could not get improvement in OS.   The randomized phase III CENTRIC and phase II CORE trials explored the integrin inhibitor cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with versus without O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. These trials failed to meet their primary endpoints . In CORE, higher αvβ3 levels in tumor cells were associated with improved progression-free survival by central review and with improved overall survival in patients treated with cilengitide. Cilengitide combined with metronomic temozolomide and procarbazine in MGMT-promoter unmethylated glioblastoma did not improve survival compared with historical data and does not warrant further investigation. The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug.

A 73-year-old woman with known MM who received little treatment for several years, presented secondary to dysarthria and at first was thought to have hyperviscosity syndrome.   After a comprehensive evaluation ruled out common causes of acute renal failure, the patient underwent testing with a bone survey, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), and immunoelectrophoresis for suspected plasma cell dyscrasia and received plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome and nephrotoxicity, which resulted in improved renal function. Lab results showed monoclonal gammopathy, elevated serum free light chains, and Bence Jones protein in the urine with a follow-up bone marrow biopsy indicating plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) and was started on chemotherapy and immunosuppression.  Plasmapheresis (PE) is recommended for patients with hyperviscosity syndrome or cast nephropathy presented with AKI, which may help to increase the dialysis-independency. Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder resulting from malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. It can cause a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to the paraproteinaemia associated with the disease. The increased hyperviscosity can lead to retinal vein occlusions and other ocular problems that may challenge clinicians.  Etiologies are various but symptomatic hyperviscosity is more common in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma.  Double filtration plasmapheresis in a dog with multiple myeloma and hyperviscosity syndrome. A 12 year old, 38 kg, mix-breed, intact male dog presented with a 20 day history of clinical signs consistent with hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to multiple myeloma.  The present study reported for the first time the use of double filtration plasmapheresis to reduce clinical signs of hyperviscosity syndrome in a dog with multiple myeloma. An otherwise healthy young man presents with bilateral CRVO as the first sign of hyperviscosity syndrome in the setting of new multiple myeloma.  In haematology the most common indication for plasmapheresis is the supportive treatment of multiple myeloma. The procedure is performed in patients with high protein levels endangered with hyperviscosity syndrome. Five to 10 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are suffered from the hyperviscosity syndrome because of increased serum viscosity due to the presence of myeloma protein. Plasmapheresis is known as an efficient method for rapid improvement of the hyperviscosity syndrome, and double filtration plasmapheresis is most commonly used for plasma exchange of multiple myeloma patients in our country. PE is the most effective method in the treatment of hyperviscosity syndrome often seen with multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and it is therapy of choice for this complication.

{"question": "Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?", "context": "Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI.  Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.  The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity.  Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known.  The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics.  CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones. Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer.  Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.  Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome. Patients with a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders. The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and germ cell neoplasia increases in Klinefelter's syndrome. There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent.

Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Those affected by Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7).

To our knowledge, the patient described here represents the first reported case of DLBCL with primary liver involvement in SS. Rituximab is also effective in the treatment of SS-associated (extrasalivary) lymphomas, although the therapeutic response in salivary lymphoma is poorer. Rituximab treatment for Sjogren syndrome-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: case series. Five per cent of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) develop malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and most frequently located in the major salivary glands.  [A case of Sjogren syndrome coexistent with MALT lymphoma occurring along the parotid gland and trachea]. Both histological examinations revealed MALT-type marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.  In the majority of patients, it is a late event and frequently associated with systemic disease or risk factors for lymphoma development. The incidence of lymphoma is higher in patients with Sjögren's syndrome than in the general population. Among the clinical and serological parameters that have been associated with lymphoma development in SS patients, the presence of palpable purpura, low C4, and mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia constitute the main predictive markers, and patients displaying these risk factors should be monitored closely. A case of pulmonary pseudolymphoma and Sjogren syndrome is presented. Furthermore, RA, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly celiac disease may share an association with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in addition to well-established links of Sjögren's syndrome with risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and of celiac disease with risk of small intestinal lymphoma.

Recent results clearly indicate an association between severity of chronic inflammation and lymphoma risk in RA and Sjögren's syndrome. Several autoimmune diseases, including primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), are associated with an increased risk for lymphoma. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) confers increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development. Furthermore, we review the emerging role of ELS and lymphoid chemokines in driving extranodal B cell lymphomagenesis in SS and we focus on recent evidence suggesting that ELS identify subsets of SS patients at increased risk of developing systemic manifestations and lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  While there are many publications on the phototoxicity of tetracyclines in general, only a few exist focusing on doxycycline.  Clinical symptoms vary from light sunburn-like sensation (burning, erythema) to large-area photodermatitis.  CONCLUSION: Evidence base must be improved for giving advice on appropriate prevention measures to travelers taking doxycycline and having a risk of significant sun exposure. Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush. Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline.

{"question": "Are paralog genes co-regulated?", "context": "Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.

Some RIDGEs (28%) consist of paralog genes while another subset (30%) are specifically dysregulated in tumors but not in normal tissues.

{"question": "Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?", "context": "The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation.  Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at their 3' ends Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the 3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up to 250-300 nucleotides long. Polyadenylation is a process of endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, followed by addition of up to 250 adenosine residues to the 3' end of the mRNA. Plant mitochondrial polyadenylated mRNAs are degraded by a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity, which proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures. We show that a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20-30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. Polyadenylation of premessenger RNAs occurs posttranscriptionally in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells by cleavage of the precursor and polymerization of adenosine residues. However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3' ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3'- to 5'- degradation process.. Auxiliary downstream elements are required for efficient polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs. Transcription in these cells is polycistronic. Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA.  During mammalian oocyte maturation, protein synthesis is mainly controlled through cytoplasmic polyadenylation of stored maternal mRNAs. Identification and characterization of a polyadenylated small RNA (s-poly A+ RNA) in dinoflagellates. Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria. Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail. We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two specificity factors and their recognition sequences The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and polyadenylation of the newly formed end.  The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases,  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a process common to almost all organisms.

Chocolate consumption may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health, Data currently available indicate that daily consumption of cocoa-rich chocolate (rich in polyphenols) may at least partially lower cardiovascular disease risk. CONCLUSIONS The blood pressure and cholesterol lowering effects of dark chocolate consumption are beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular events in a population with metabolic syndrome. Daily dark chocolate consumption could be an effective cardiovascular preventive strategy in this population. BACKGROUND The consumption of chocolate and cocoa has established cardiovascular benefits. CONCLUSIONS Chocolate consumption is associated with lower risk of MI and ischaemic heart disease. Chocolate consumption was inversely associated with MI risk. Chocolate consumption is associated with lower risk of MI and ischaemic heart disease. The consumption of cocoa/ chocolate (i) increases plasma antioxidant capacity, (ii) diminishes platelet function and inflammation, and (iii) decreases diastolic and systolic arterial pressures. Chocolate consumption was inversely associated with MI risk. Chocolate consumption is inversely associated with prevalent coronary heart disease: the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study. Daily chocolate consumption is inversely associated with insulin resistance and liver enzymes in the Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg study.

CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.  It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis. The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations. RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India. PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis.

Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br> Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.  Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.   Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA. Sleep apnea Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.  Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction.

Using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, we found that Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect. IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli.

Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates.  The peculiarities of large intron splicing in animals. These \"large introns\" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing Subdivision of large introns in Drosophila by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns>20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns<10 kb. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The effect of splice site strength was context-dependent and much more significant for the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron than for the 3' splice site of the shorter alternative intron and the common 5' splice sites; it was also more significant in the rat minigene than in the mouse minigene.
